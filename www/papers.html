<H3>ChemCell Papers 
</H3>
<P>The following papers describe the ChemCell code and modeling problems
it has been applied to.
</P>
<P>If you wish to cite ChemCell, please use the Journal of Physics paper
for now.  A better paper has been submitted to Bioinformatics; we will
post the reference here, if it is accepted.
</P>
<P>If you send information about a paper that uses ChemCell results, I'll
be pleased to add info about it to this page.  Ditto for a picture or
movie for the <A HREF = "pictures.html">Pictures & Movies</A> page.

<P>This paper is about our <A HREF = "http://www.genomes2life.org">Genomics:GTL (Genomes-to-Life) project</A>
funded by DOE's OBER and OASCR offices, that provided funding and
motivation for the development of ChemCell.  The author list is the
entire project team!
