Funding for ChemCell :h3

ChemCell development has been funded by the US Department of Energy
("DOE"_doe), through its CRADA, LDRD, ASCI, and Genomes-to-Life
programs.  This funding has come from DOE's "OASCR"_oascr and
"OBER"_ober offices.

Work on the latest version of ChemCell was funded in part by the US
Department of Energy's Genomics:GTL program
("www.doegenomestolife.org"_gtl) under the "project"_ourgtl, "Carbon
Sequestration in Synechococcus Sp.: From Molecular Machines to
Hierarchical Modeling".

Pizza.py Thanks :h3

This page acknowledges our funding, contributors to Pizza.py, and the
various software packages wrapped and accessed by Pizza.py.

Pizza.py has been developed at "Sandia National Laboratories"_sandia
which is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a
Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy's
National Nuclear Security Administration under contract
DE-AC04-94AL85000.

Funding for Pizza.py development has come from the US Department of
Energy ("DOE"_doe), through its LDRD and Genomes-to-Life programs.
The latter effort has been funded by DOE's "OASCR"_oascr and
"OBER"_ober offices as part of the US Department of Energy's
Genomics:GTL program ("www.doegenomestolife.org"_gtl) under the
"project"_ourgtl, "Carbon Sequestration in Synechococcus Sp.: From
Molecular Machines to Hierarchical Modeling".

The maintainer of Pizza.py is "Steve Plimpton"_sjp.

Matt Jones, a BYU student who was a summer intern at Sandia, wrote
several of the coolest tools in Pizza.py and about half the code in
the initial version.  Considering Matt didn't even know Python when he
started, his contribution is a kudo to Matt's abilities and to the
ease with which Python enables people to do complex stuff quickly!

These folks have contributed code for tools or scripts that
are part of the Pizza.py distribution:

pair tool: Paul Crozier (Sandia)
block.py script: Paul Crozier (Sandia)
density.py script: Paul Crozier (Sandia)
flux.py script: Paul Crozier (Sandia)
group_energy.py script: Paul Crozier (Sandia) :tb(s=:)

Finally, I also wish to thank the following individuals and their
software, without which Pizza.py would not be very useful:

Rick Muller at Sandia for Python advice and encouragement and his
"Vimes"_vimes (Visual Interface to Materials Simulation) package
written in Python that shares a common vision with Pizza.py.

:link(vimes,http://vimes.sourceforge.net)

Nathan Gray, who wrote "LazyPython.py"_gray, which showed me how to
make the top-level of Pizza.py both simple and functional.

:link(gray,http://www.idyll.org/~n8gray/code/index.html)

Mike Fletcher, the head of the "PyOpenGL"_pyopengl project, which
allows Pizza.py to do 3d interactive OpenGL visualization.

:link(pyopengl,http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net)

Authors of great, freely-available software that Pizza.py is able to
wrap and use to good effect - "RasMol"_rasmol, "Raster3d"_raster3d,
"GnuPlot"_gnuplot.
