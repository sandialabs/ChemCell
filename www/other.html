<P>The first 3 are similar in spirit to ChemCell, meaning they model
biochemical networks of reacting/diffusing chemical species within a
spatial geometry via particles.  VCell uses continuum PDEs for
reaction/diffusion in a spatial representation of the cell.  E-Cell
provides a rich set of continuum and stochastic solvers for
non-spatial cell models.

<P>ChemCell itself does not perform visualization of its output.  Since
its output is snapshots of particles, these are high-quality particle
visualizers we recommend.

<P>Our group has also written and released a separate toolkit called
<A HREF = "../pizza.html">Pizza.py</A> which provides tools for doing ChemCell pre-
and post-processing, including model creation, plotting, and
visualization.  Pizza.py is written in <A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A>,
is available for download from <A HREF = "../download.html">this page</A>.
