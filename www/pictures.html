<H4><A NAME = "dendrimer"></A>Solvated dendritic polymer structure 
</H4>
<P>This is work by <A HREF = "http://www.wag.caltech.edu/home/jsshys">Seung Soon Jang</A> (jsshys@wag.caltech.edu) in
Bill Goddard's group at Cal Tech.  They've developed a model for a
dendrion diblock copolymer consisting of a dendritic polymer with a
hydrophobic backbone.  The 1st paper listed is a study of its
structural and dynamical properties in water.  Such materials have
interesting nanoscale structural and phase behavior.
</P>
<P>They've also studied amphiphilic bistable (2)rotaxane molecules which
have controllable switching properties as their conformation changes.
The 2nd paper discusses simulations of this system.
</P>


<P>The 1st picture is the molecular structures of a diblock copolymer
system at two different levels of water content.  The 2nd picture
illustrates conformational changes in a Langmuir monolayer of the
rotaxane molecules.
