Solvated dendritic polymer structure :h4,link(dendrimer)

This is work by "Seung Soon Jang"_jang (jsshys@wag.caltech.edu) in
Bill Goddard's group at Cal Tech.  They've developed a model for a
dendrion diblock copolymer consisting of a dendritic polymer with a
hydrophobic backbone.  The 1st paper listed is a study of its
structural and dynamical properties in water.  Such materials have
interesting nanoscale structural and phase behavior.

They've also studied amphiphilic bistable (2)rotaxane molecules which
have controllable switching properties as their conformation changes.
The 2nd paper discusses simulations of this system.

:link(jang,http://www.wag.caltech.edu/home/jsshys)

The 1st picture is the molecular structures of a diblock copolymer
system at two different levels of water content.  The 2nd picture
illustrates conformational changes in a Langmuir monolayer of the
rotaxane molecules.

Metal solidification :h4,link(solidify)

This is work by "Mark Asta's"_asta group at Northwestern and Jeff Hoyt
(jjhoyt@sandia.gov) at Sandia.  They've developed a simulation
strategy for solidifying metals and metal alloys where the temperature
of the sytem is carefully thermostatted so that the velocity of the
interface can be accurately measured.

Lipid membrane self-assembly and fusion :h4,link(membrane)

This is work by Mark Stevens (msteve@sandia.gov) at Sandia on the
self-assembly of lipid bilayers and membrane fusion using an idealized
bead-spring model for a 2-tail lipid molecule.

Head-head and head-solvent interactions are set to give hydrophyllic
behavior.  Head-tail and tail-solvent interactions are hydrophobic.  A
3d random ensemble of lipid molecules in a background solvent will
spontaneously self-assemble into bilayers and vesicles as shown by
these 2d slice views.  When 2 vesicles are gently pushed together they
can fuse as tails of individual lipid molecules straddle both
membranes.  The detailed fusion images were made with "VMD"_vmd.

Tensile pull on adhesive polymer chains :h4,link(adhesion)

This is work by Scott Sides (swsides@mrl.ucsb.edu), Gary Grest
(gsgrest@sandia.gov), and Mark Stevens (msteve@sandia.gov), all at Sandia,
on adhesive properties of polymers.

The simulations are of melts of 500- and 1000-mer bead-spring chains.
The systems range from 100-500K total monomers and are run for 10-20
million timesteps.  In these snapshots of models with different
parameters, the blue chains are the melt, red are tethered and
unbroken chains, green are tethered and broken.

Crazing of entangled polymer chains :h4,link(crazing)

This is work by "Joerg Rottler"_rottler (now at Princeton) and "Mark
Robbins"_robbins at JHU.  The image shows a polymer glass that has
been deformed into a craze at large strains.  In the craze, polymers
(~0.5 nm diameter) are bundled into an intricate load-bearing network
of ~10 nm diameter fibrils.  Crazing is largely responsible for the
high fracture energy of glassy polymers.

Stress in metal nanowires :h4,link(wires)

This is work by "Min Zhou's"_zhou group at Georgia Tech on modeling
the effect of tensile stress at varying strain rates on single-crystal
Cu nanowires of varying dimensions.  In the image, atoms are colored
to highlight defects and the transverse dimensions are drawn at an
exaggerated scale.

Shear of large single-crystal metals :h4,link(shear)

This is work with Mark Horstemeyer (mfhorst@me.msstate.edu) at
Mississippi State (formerly at Sandia) and Mike Baskes
(baskes@lanl.gov) at LANL to study stress/strain effects in large
single-crystal metals samples.  Simulations with up to 100M atoms were
run.  This image shows defect formation in a quasi-2d Ni sample
undergoing fixed-end shear, where the z-dimension (into the image) is
periodic but very thin.  The black lines indicate atom displacements
as the sample has sheared to the right.
