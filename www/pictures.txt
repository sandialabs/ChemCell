Solvated dendritic polymer structure :h4,link(dendrimer)

This is work by "Seung Soon Jang"_jang (jsshys@wag.caltech.edu) in
Bill Goddard's group at Cal Tech.  They've developed a model for a
dendrion diblock copolymer consisting of a dendritic polymer with a
hydrophobic backbone.  The 1st paper listed is a study of its
structural and dynamical properties in water.  Such materials have
interesting nanoscale structural and phase behavior.

They've also studied amphiphilic bistable (2)rotaxane molecules which
have controllable switching properties as their conformation changes.
The 2nd paper discusses simulations of this system.

The 1st picture is the molecular structures of a diblock copolymer
system at two different levels of water content.  The 2nd picture
illustrates conformational changes in a Langmuir monolayer of the
rotaxane molecules.
