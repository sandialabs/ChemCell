<H3>New Features and Bug Fixes in ChemCell 
</H3>
<P>This page lists new features and bug fixes in the ChemCell simulator
since the current version was released.
</P>
<P>To add these features/fixes to your version of ChemCell, download the
upgraded version from the <A HREF = "../download.html">download page</A>, that
includes all these features/fixes, and rebuild the code.
</P>
<P>The current version of ChemCell is 10 Sept 2008.

<P>Made some enhancements to make particle binning more efficient for
problems where the natural diffusion length scale is different than
the reaction length scale.  Before ChemCell used one bin size for
finding geometry during particle moves and for finding reaction
partners during chemistry.  Now the <A HREF = "bin.html">bin</A> command lets you
specify separate length scales leading to two different sets of bins.
This can make a spatial simulation dramatically faster, if for
example, you can use smaller reaction bins than geometry bins.

<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.13Mar09">list of changed files</A> from the 19
Sept 2008 version.

<P>Thanks to Steve Andrews (TMSI) for providing a problem that
illustrated this issue.

<P>Fixed some incorrect filenames generated by the
<A HREF = "doc/variable.html">variable</A> command which would affect using
universe-style variables.
</P>

Sept 2008 version.

<P>Fixed some broken links in doc pages.  This is really a test of
the scripts I use to generate an updated tarball and the list of
patched files.
