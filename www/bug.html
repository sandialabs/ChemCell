<H3>Latest Features and Bug Fixes in ChemCell 
</H3>
<P>This page is a continuous listing of new features and bug fixes in the
ChemCell simulator.
</P>
<P>To stay up-to-date with the current ChemCell, you can download the
current tarball from the <A HREF = "download.html">download page</A> at any time,
which will include all the features/fixes listed below, and re-build
ChemCell from scratch.

<H4><A NAME = "version"></A>What version of ChemCell do you have? 
</H4>
<P>A ChemCell "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Sept
2010.  ChemCell is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or
add a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of ChemCell contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  The version date is printed to the
screen and logfile every time you run ChemCell.  It is also in the file
src/version.h and in the ChemCell directory name created when you
unpack a tarball.
</P>
<UL><LI>If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the ChemCell WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of ChemCell. 

<LI>If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages included in your tarball, they
describe the version you have.

<P>Added some tweaks for particle handling and communication.
</P>
<P>Also added continuous version dating and updated the PDF manual.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.27May11">list of changed files</A> from the 15
Apr 2009 version.

<P>This upgrade adds some updated doc pages that got left out
in previous upgrades.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.15Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 13
Mar 2009 version.

<P>Made some enhancements to make particle binning more efficient for
problems where the natural diffusion length scale is different than
the reaction length scale.  Before ChemCell used one bin size for
finding geometry during particle moves and for finding reaction
partners during chemistry.  Now the <A HREF = "doc/bin.html">bin</A> command lets
you specify separate length scales leading to two different sets of
bins.  This can make a spatial simulation dramatically faster, if, for
example, you can use smaller reaction bins than geometry bins.

<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.13Mar09">list of changed files</A> from the 19
Sept 2008 version.

<P>Thanks to Steve Andrews (TMSI) for providing a problem that
illustrated this issue.

<P><B>19 Sept 2008</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed some incorrect filenames generated by the
<A HREF = "doc/variable.html">variable</A> command which would affect using
universe-style variables.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.19Sep08">list of changed files</A> from the 18
Sept 2008 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>18 Sept 2008</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed some broken links in doc pages.  This is really a test of
the scripts I use to generate an updated tarball and the list of
patched files.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.18Sep08">list of changed files</A> from the 10
Sept 2008 version.

<HR>

<P><B>10 Sept 2008</B>
</P>
<P>Initial public release of ChemCell.  18,882 lines of code in src dir.
This version supercedes earlier distributed beta versions.
