This page lists new features and bug fixes in the ChemCell molecular

ChemCell from scratch.  Or you can apply individual patch files to your
copy of ChemCell as described below.

[Applying patches:]

Download the patch file.  You may have to shift-click in your browser
to download the file instead of display it.  Patch files have names
like patch.7Sept04. :ulb,l

Put the patch file in your top-level ChemCell directory, where the
LICENSE and README files are. :l

Apply the patch by typing the following command from the top-level
ChemCell directory, where the redirected file is the name of the patch
file. :l

patch -bp4 < patch.7Sept04 :pre

A list of updated files print out to the screen.  The -b switch
creates backup files of your originals (e.g. src/react.cpp.orig), so
you can manually undo the patch if something goes wrong. :l

Re-make ChemCell and you have the bug-fix or new feature. :l,ule

Additional notes:

If you wish to apply several patches, you can apply them in any order,
unless otherwise indicated, in which case you should apply them in
order of their dates. :ulb,l

The link to a "list of changed files" will tell you what files the
patch modifies in case you have edited those files yourself. :l,ule
