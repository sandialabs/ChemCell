<P>ChemCell runs on single-processor machines or in parallel using
message-passing techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the
simulation domain.  The code is designed to be easy to modify or
extend with new functionality.  It's distributed as an <A HREF = "ChemCell/open_source.html">open source
code</A> under the terms of the <A HREF = "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</A>
license and can be downloaded from <A HREF = "download.html">this site</A> or from
