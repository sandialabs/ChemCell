These are other biological cell simulators, which may be well-suited
to the problems you want to model.

The first 3 are similar in spirit to ChemCell, meaning they model
biochemical networks of reacting/diffusing chemical species within a
spatial geometry via particles.  VCell uses continuum PDEs for
reaction/diffusion in a spatial representation of the cell.  E-Cell
provides a rich set of continuum and stochastic solvers for
non-spatial cell models.

Visualization Packages :h4,link(viz)

ChemCell itself does not perform visualization of its output.  Since
its output is snapshots of particles, these are high-quality particle
visualizers we recommend.

Our group has also written and released a separate toolkit called
"Pizza.py"_../pizza.html which provides tools for doing ChemCell pre-
and post-processing, including model creation, plotting, and
visualization.  Pizza.py is written in "Python"_http://www.python.org,
is available for download from "this page"_../download.html.
