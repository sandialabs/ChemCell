Open-Source Distribution :h3

ChemCell comes with no warranty of any kind.  As each source file states
in its header, it is a copyrighted code that is distributed free-of-
charge, under the terms of the "GNU Public License"_gnu (GPL).  This
is often referred to as open-source distribution - see
"www.gnu.org"_gnuorg or "www.opensource.org"_opensource.  The legal
text of the GPL is in the LICENSE file that is included in the ChemCell
distribution.

Here is a summary of what the GPL means for ChemCell users:

(1) Anyone is free to use, modify, or extend ChemCell in any way they
choose, including for commercial purposes.

(2) If you distribute a modified version of ChemCell, it must remain
open-source, meaning you distribute it under the terms of the GPL.
You should clearly annotate such a code as a derivative version of
ChemCell.

(3) If you release any code that includes ChemCell source code, then it
must also be open-sourced, meaning you distribute it under the terms
of the GPL.

(4) If you give ChemCell files to someone else, the GPL LICENSE file and
source file headers (including the copyright and GPL notices) should
remain part of the code.
