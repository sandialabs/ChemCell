ChemCell Papers :h3

The following papers describe the ChemCell code and modeling problems
it has been applied to.

If you wish to cite ChemCell, please use the Journal of Physics paper
for now.  A better paper has been submitted to Bioinformatics; we will
post the reference here, if it is accepted.

If you send information about a paper that uses ChemCell results, I'll
be pleased to add info about it to this page.  Ditto for a picture or
movie for the "Pictures & Movies"_pictures.html page.

This paper discusses results from network analyses performed
with ChemCell:

[Sensitivity Analysis of a Computational Model of the IKK-NF-kB-A20
Signal Transduction Network], J. Joo, S. J. Plimpton, S. Martin,
L. Swiler, J. L. Faulon, Annals of the New York Acadamey of Sciences,
Volume on Reverse Engineering Biological Networks, 1115, 221-239
(2007). ("abstract"_../abstracts/annals07.html)

This paper gives a brief overview of ChemCell and computational
challenges for cell modeling:

[Microbial cell modeling via reacting diffusing particles],
S. J. Plimpton and A. Slepoy, Journal of Physics: Conference Series
16, 305-309 (2005). ("abstract"_ajp) ("pdf"_pjp)

This paper is about our "Genomics:GTL (Genomes-to-Life) project"_gtl
funded by DOE's OBER and OASCR offices, that provided funding and
motivation for the development of ChemCell.  The author list is the
entire project team!
