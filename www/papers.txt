Citing LAMMPS in your papers :h3

The following papers describe the parallel algorithms used in LAMMPS.
If you use LAMMPS results in your published work, please cite the J
Comp Phys reference and include the URL of the "LAMMPS WWW Site"_lws
at www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/lammps.html.  A paper describing the
latest version of LAMMPS is in preparation; when it appears in print,
you can check this site for a more current citation.

Dynamics], J Comp Phys, 117, 1-19 (1995). ("abstract"_absjcomps95)

If you send me information about any of your publications that use
LAMMPS results, I'll be pleased to add them to the Publications page
of the "LAMMPS WWW Site"_lws.  Ditto for a picture or movie for the
Pictures or Movies pages.
