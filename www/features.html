<H3>ChemCell Features 
</H3>
<P>ChemCell is a particle-based reaction/diffusion simulator designed to
model signaling, regulatory, or metabolic networks in biological
cells.  It can be run as a spatial simulator where the particles
diffuse within the specified geometry of a cell, or as a non-spatial
simulator where there is no diffusion and the network of chemical
reactions is time-integrated as a set of ODEs or stochastically via
the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA).
</P>
<P>For spatial simulations, a single protein, protein complex, or other
biomolecule is represented as a dimensionless particle.  The geometry
of a cell (membranes, organelles, etc) is represented as simple
geometrical objects (spheres, boxes, etc) or as triangulated surfaces.
Particles diffuse randomly via Brownian motion, either in 3d or on 2d
surfaces.  Biochemical reactions occur in accord with chemical rate
equations, which are inputs to ChemCell.  Monte Carlo rules are used
to perform reactions each timestep between pairs of nearby particles.
</P>
<P>For non-spatial simulations, the cell is treated as a well-mixed
chemical reactor, and the chemical rate equations can be
time-integrated either by a fixed-step or adaptive-timestep ODE solver
or by the direct-method variant of the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation
Algorithm (SSA) using the Gibson/Bruck methodology.
</P>
<P>ChemCell runs on single-processor desktop or laptop machines, but can
also be run in parallel.  Multiple runs can be performed on a
collection of processors (for statistical purposes), or (for spatial
simulations) the simulation domain can be partitioned across
processors and a single simulation run in parallel.  For spatial
simulations, ChemCell can model systems with only a few particles up
to many millions.
</P>


<P>ChemCell is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the
terms of the <A HREF = "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Public License</A>, which means you can use or
modify the code however you wish.  See <A HREF = "open_source.html">this page</A>
for a brief discussion of the open-source philosophy.
</P>


<P>ChemCell is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
capabilities, such as modified reaction rules or boundary conditions.
See <A HREF = "doc/Section_modify.html">this section</A> for more details.
</P>
<P>ChemCell is written in C++ and can be downloaded from the <A HREF = "../chemcell.html">ChemCell
WWW Site</A>.  No additional software is needed to run ChemCell in
serial on a desktop machine.  ChemCell will run on any parallel
machine that compiles C++ and supports the <A HREF = "http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi">MPI</A> message-passing
library.  This includes distributed- or shared-memory parallel
machines and Beowulf-style clusters.  To run with spatial parallelism,
the <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan">Zoltan library</A> must also be installed.
</P>


<P>ChemCell does not have the ability to create cellular geometries or
visualize simulation output.  Currently, these tasks are handled by
pre- and post-processing codes.  Our group has written a separate
toolkit called <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py</A> which provides tools for doing setup,
analysis, plotting, and visualization for ChemCell simulations.
Pizza.py is written in <A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A> and is available for download
from <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">the Pizza.py WWW site</A>.
