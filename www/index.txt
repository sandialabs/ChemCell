ChemCell is a particle-based reaction/diffusion simulator designed for
modeling protein networks in biological cells with spatial
information.  Compartments within the cell are bounded by membrane
surfaces defined as geometric regions or connected triangles.
Particles represent individual biomolecules and diffuse via Brownian
motion in 3d and on 2d surfaces.  Particles react with neighboring
particles according to rules derived from chemical rate equations.
Non-spatial models can also be run using an ODE solver or the
Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA).  Spatial simulations
can be run in parallel as can multiple instances of non-spatial
simluations for statistical averaging.  The "Pizza.py
package"_pizza of Python-based tools can create input files for
ChemCell and visualize and plot its output.

ChemCell was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US
Department of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE, acknowledged
"here"_thanks.html.  It is an open-source code, designed to
be easy to modify and extend with new functionality.  It is

This is work with Jaewook Joo (Sandia).  He developed a hybrid model
of the NF-kB immune response network (by combining two models in the
literature due to Alexander Hoffman and Tomasz Lipniacki).  Triggered
by receptor binding to a stimulant at the cell membrane, IKK is
produced inside the cell which is the starting point for the portion
of the network we modeled, which contains approximately 50 species and
70 reactions.  Eventually NF-kB, a gene transcription factor, is
produced and enters the nucleus.  Due to negative feedback in the
network, an oscillatory response of nuclear-NF-KB can result as it
shuttles in and out of the nucleus.

This non-spatial 2-compartment model was simulated in ChemCell both as
a continuum model (ODE solver) and a stochastic model (Gillespie SSA).
Runs in batches of 1000 and 10,000 were performed while varying
parameters in the model to perform senstivity analyses and classify
the various kinds of responses.  The image shows 4 plots for the
different observed responses: sustained oscillatory, damped
oscillatory, single-peaked, and hyperbolic (saturation to a maximum).
The red curves are the ODE solutions; the green are stochastic.  These
results indicate the stochastic noise present in real cells can blur
the distinction between the different responses and induce
oscillations.
