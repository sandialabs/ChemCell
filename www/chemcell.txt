ChemCell runs on single-processor machines or in parallel using
message-passing techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the
simulation domain.  The code is designed to be easy to modify or
extend with new functionality.  It's distributed as an "open source
code"_ChemCell/open_source.html under the terms of the "GPL"_gpl
license and can be downloaded from "this site"_download.html or from
