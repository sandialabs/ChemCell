check command :h3

[Syntax:]

check species-ID surf-ID flag lo hi plo phi :pre

species-ID = particle species to check
surf-ID = surface to check
flag = {in} or {out} or {none}
lo,hi = optional timestep bounds
plo,phi = optional particle index bounds :ul

[Examples:]

check Ca_cyto ER_surf out 1000 2000 :pre

[Description:]

Check particles of species-ID to see if they are inside or outside of
the surface with surf-ID.  A warning will be printed if a particle
does not satisfy the check condition.  This can be useful for
debugging purposes to test if particles have leaked thru a boundary
they shouldn't have and to identify on what timestep the leakage
occurred.

The flag determines whether the check is for the particles being
inside or outside the surface.  A value of {none} means do not perform
the check.  This command can be used multiple times to specify
combinations of particle species and surfaces to check.

The surf-ID is assumed to be a closed set of triangles or closed
region.  Performing a check for a triangulated surface is expensive;
all triangles are looped over for each particle.

Lo/hi are optional timestep values between which (inclusive) the check
is done.  If not specified, a check is performed every timestep.

Plo/phi are optional particle indices (0 to N-1) to specify a subset
of particles (inclusive) to perform the check on.  If not specified
all particles (of the specified species) are checked.  Note that lo/hi
must be specified in order to also specify plo/phi.

[Restrictions:]

Only 3d particles can be checked.

[Default:]

No particle-surface checks are performed.
