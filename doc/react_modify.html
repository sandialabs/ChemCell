  <I>loc</I> values = product styleflag whichflag dirflag
    product = which product (1-N)
    styleflag = <I>def</I> or <I>at</I> or <I>near</I>

    dirflag = <I>def</I> or <I>in</I> or <I>out</I> or <I>in/out</I>
  <I>dist</I> = R
    R = distance at which reactants will react (microns)
  <I>prob</I> = P
    P = probability (0-1) with which reactants react
  <I>weight</I> values = which index ratio
    which = <I>reactant</I> or <I>product</I>
    index = which reactant or product (1-N)
    ratio = weighting factor to apply

<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>react_modify 1 dist 0.05 prob 1.0

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Reset one or more parameters of a specific reaction.
</P>
<P>The <I>rate</I> keyword resets the reaction rate.
</P>
<P>The <I>loc</I> keyword sets the location at which a product of the reaction
is placed.  The <I>product</I> setting determines which product (1 to N).
A value of -1 means all products.  The <I>styleflag</I> setting refers to
placing the product at or near a reactant's location.  The <I>whichflag</I>
setting refers to which reactant (1 to N) to place the product at or
near.  A value of <I>1/2</I> means to randomly choose which reactant each
time a reaction occurs.  The <I>dirflag</I> setting only applies to 3d
products placed near 2d reactants and refers to which side of the
surface (inside or outside) to place the product on.  A value of
<I>in/out</I> means to randomly choose the side each time a reaction
occurs.  A value of <I>def</I> for default should be used if <I>dirflag</I> does
not apply.
</P>
<P>Depending on the kind of reaction (1 or 2 reactants) and whether the
reactants are 3d diffusing species or 2d (on a surface), certain
combinations of settings are invalid and will generate errors.  Note
that only 3d products can be placed at a 3d reactant's location.  Only
2d products can be placed at a 2d reactant's location.  And only 3d
products can be placed near a 2d reactant's location, which means to
place it a distance epsilon from the surface the 2d reactant is on.
</P>
<P>These are the default rules for reactions with a single reactant:
</P>
<UL><LI>If the reactant and product are 3d,   put the product at the location of the reactant.
<LI>If the reactant and product are 2d,   put the product at the location of the reactant.
<LI>If the reactant is 3d and the product is 2d, this is an error.
<LI>If the reactant is 2d and the product is 3d,   put the product near the reactant on the inside of the surface. 
</UL>
<P>These are the default rules for reactions with two reactants:
</P>
<UL><LI>If both reactants and the product are 2d, put the product at the   location of the reactant with the smaller diffusion coeff.
<LI>If both reactants and the product are 3d, put the product at the   location of the reactant with the smaller diffusion coeff.
<LI>If one reactant is 2d and the other 3d and the product is 3d, put the   product at the 3d reactant's location.
<LI>If one reactant is 2d and the other 3d and the product is 2d, put the   product at the 2d reactant's location.
<LI>If both reactants are 3d and the product is 2d, this is an error.
<LI>If both reactants are 2d and the product is 3d, put the product   a distance epsilon away from the reactant with the smaller diffusion coeff   on the inside of the surface.
<LI>In all cases where diffusion coeffs are used, if the diffusion coeffs of   the 2 reactants are equal, the 1st reactant is used. 
</UL>
<P>The <I>dist</I> keyword explicitly sets the cutoff distance for a binary
reaction bewteen two reactants.  Normally, ChemCell sets this distance
itself (see the <A HREF = "probability.html">probability</A> command for options).
Setting the <I>dist</I> value to -1.0 turns off the explicit setting;
ChemCell will again compute the reaction cutoff.
</P>
<P>The <I>prob</I> keyword explicitly sets the probablility (from 0.0 to 1.0)
for a binary reaction to take place (assuming the reactants are within
the cutoff distance).  Normally, ChemCell sets this probability itself
(see the <A HREF = "probability.html">probability</A> command for options).  Setting
the <I>prob</I> value to -1.0 turns off the explicit setting; ChemCell will
again compute the probability.
</P>
<P>Note that the <I>dist</I> and <I>prob</I> keywords give you the option of
setting reaction parameters directly, using your own formulation or
algorithms and settings from another code.  For example, the
<A HREF = "http://www.smoldyn.org">Smoldyn</A> simulator calculates a variety of reaction
parameterizations for different kinds of reactions, as described in
<A HREF = "#Andrews">(Andrews)</A>.  Essentially it computes reaction cutoff
distances (binding radii in Smoldyn nomenclature) as a function of
diffusion coefficients of the reactants, timestep, and reaction rate.
The Smoldyn formulation spans the spectrum from diffusion-limited to
reaction-limited reactions and thus produces reaction cutoff distances
which are more accurate and complete than the simple heuristic that
ChemCell uses by default.
</P>
<P>The <I>weight</I> keyword sets a volume weighting factor for a specific
reactant or product which adjusts its concentration the reaction
occurs and the species is removed or produced.  This can be used by
non-spatial, continuum simulations (ODEs) to weight the effects of a
reaction.  The weighting factor can be thought of as a volume ratio
between 2 compartments, so a factor can be set to enable a
multi-compartment ODE solution where each compartment has its own
volume.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> none
</P>
<P>The <I>loc</I> and <I>dist</I> and <I>prob</I> keywords only apply to spatial
simulations.  The <I>weight</I> keyword only applies to non-spatial,
continuum (ODE) simulations.
