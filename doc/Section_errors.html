<H3>7. Errors 
</H3>
<P>This section describes the various kinds of errors you can encounter
when using ChemCell.

7.1 <A HREF = "#7_1">Common problems</A><BR>

<A NAME = "7_1"></A><H4>7.1 Common problems 
</H4>
<P>If two ChemCell runs do not produce the same answer on different
machines or different numbers of processors, this is typically not a
bug.  In theory you should get identical answers on any number of
processors and on any machine.  In practice, the use of random numbers
by ChemCell will cause differences in spatial simulations (see the
<A HREF = "sort.html">sort</A> command for more info) leading to divergent
trajectories for two simulations.  Even non-spatial simulations can
incur numerical round-off which can cause slight differences and
eventual divergence of phase space trajectories within a few 100s or
few 1000s of timesteps.  However, the statistical properties of the
two runs (e.g. average energy or temperature) should still be the
same.
</P>
<P>A ChemCell simulation typically has two stages, setup and run.  Most
ChemCell errors are detected at setup time; others may not occur until
the middle of a run.
</P>
<P>ChemCell tries to flag errors and print informative error messages so
you can fix the problem.  Of course ChemCell cannot figure out your
physics mistakes, like choosing too big a timestep, specifying invalid
reaction rates, or building an invalid geometry!  If you find errors
that ChemCell doesn't catch that you think it should flag, please send
us an <A HREF = "mailto:sjplimp@sandia.gov">email</A>.
</P>


<P>If you get an error message about an invalid command in your input
script, you can determine what command is causing the problem by
looking in the log.ChemCell file or using the <A HREF = "echo.html">echo command</A>
to see it on the screen.  For a given command, ChemCell expects certain
arguments in a specified order.  If you mess this up, ChemCell will
often flag the error, but it may read a bogus argument and assign a
value that is valid, but not what you wanted.  E.g. trying to read the
string "abc" as an integer value and assigning the associated variable
a value of 0.
</P>
<P>Generally, ChemCell will print a message to the screen and exit
gracefully when it encounters a fatal error.  Sometimes it will print
a WARNING and continue on; you can decide if the WARNING is important
or not.  If ChemCell crashes or hangs without spitting out an error
message first then it could be a bug (see <A HREF = "#9_2">this section</A>) or one
of the following cases:
</P>
<P>ChemCell runs in the available memory a processor allows to be
allocated.  Most reasonable runs are compute limited, not memory
limited, so this shouldn't be a bottleneck on most platforms.  Almost
all large memory allocations in the code are done via C-style malloc's
which will generate an error message if you run out of memory.
Smaller chunks of memory are allocated via C++ "new" statements.  If
you are unlucky you could run out of memory just when one of these
small requests is made, in which case the code will crash or hang (in
parallel), since ChemCell doesn't trap on those errors.
</P>
<P>Illegal arithmetic can cause ChemCell to run slow or crash.  This is
typically due to invalid physics and numerics that your simulation is
computing.  If you see wild thermodynamic values or NaN values in your
ChemCell output, something is wrong with your simulation.
</P>
<P>In parallel, one way ChemCell can hang is due to how different MPI
implementations handle buffering of messages.  If the code hangs
without an error message, it may be that you need to specify an MPI
setting or two (usually via an environment variable) to enable
buffering or boost the sizes of messages that can be buffered.

<A NAME = "7_2"></A><H4>7.2 Reporting bugs 
</H4>
<P>If you are confident that you have found a bug in ChemCell, we'd like to
know about it via <A HREF = "mailto:sjplimp@sandia.gov">email</A>.
</P>
<P>First, check the "New features and bug fixes" section of the <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/chemcell.html">ChemCell
WWW site</A> to see if the bug has already been reported or fixed.
</P>
<P>If not, the most useful thing you can do for us is to isolate the
problem.  Run it on the smallest number of atoms and fewest number of
processors and with the simplest input script that reproduces the bug.
</P>
<P>Send an email that describes the problem and any ideas you have as to
what is causing it or where in the code the problem might be.  We'll
request your input script and data files if necessary.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "7_3"></A>7.3 Error & warning Messages 
</H4>
<P>These are two alphabetic lists of the <A HREF = "#error">ERROR</A> and
<A HREF = "#warn">WARNING</A> messages ChemCell prints out and the reason why.  If the
explanation here is not sufficient, the documentation for the
offending command may help.  Grepping the source files for the text of
the error message and staring at the source code and comments is also
not a bad idea!  Note that sometimes the same message can be printed
from multiple places in the code.
