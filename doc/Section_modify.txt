6. Modifying & extending ChemCell :h3

ChemCell is designed in a modular fashion so as to be easy to modify
and extend with new functionality.  In this section, changes and
additions users can make are listed along with some minimal
instructions.  Realistically, the best way to add a new feature is to
find a similar feature in ChemCell and look at the corresponding
source and header files to figure out what it does.  You will need
some knowledge of C++ to be able to understand the hi-level structure
of ChemCell and its class organization, but functions (class methods)
that do actual computations are written in vanilla C-style code and
typically operate on simple C-style data structures (vectors and
arrays).

Most of the new features described in this section require you to
write a new C++ class.  Creating a new class requires 2 files, a
source code file (*.cpp) and a header file (*.h).  Their contents are
briefly discussed below.  Enabling ChemCell to invoke the new class is
as simple as adding two definition lines to the style.h file, in the
same syntax as the existing ChemCell classes are defined in the
style.h file.

The power of C++ and its object-orientation is that usually, all the
code and variables needed to define the new feature are contained in
the 2 files you write, and thus shouldn't make the rest of the code
more complex or cause side-effect bugs.

Here is a concrete example.  Suppose you write 2 files fix_foo.cpp and
fix_foo.h that define a new class FixFoo that implements a boundary
condition described in the classic 1997 "paper"_#Foo by Foo, et. al.
If you wish to invoke that boundary condition in a ChemCell input
script with a command like

fix 1 foo 0.1 3.5 :pre

you simply need to put your 2 files in the ChemCell src directory, add
2 lines to the style.h file, and re-make the code.

The first line added to style.h would be

FixStyle(foo,FixFoo) :pre

in the #ifdef FixClass section, where "foo" is the style keyword in
the pair_style command, and FixFoo is the class name in your C++
files.

The 2nd line added to style.h would be

#include "fix_foo.h" :pre

in the #ifdef FixInclude section, where fix_foo.h is the name of your
new include file.

When you re-make ChemCell, your new boundary condition becomes part of
the executable and can be invoked with a fix command like the example
above.  Arguments like 0.1 and 3.5 can be defined and processed by
your new class.

Note that if you are using Makefile.list instead of Makefile to build
ChemCell, you will need to explicitly add the names of your new .cpp and
.h file to Makefile.list.

Here is a list of the kinds of new features that can be added in this
way:

"Region geometry options"_#region
"Fix options"_#fix which include boundary conditions, \
   diagnostic output, etc
"Simulator options"_#simulator
"New top-level commands"_#command :ul

As illustrated by the fix example, these options are referred to in
the ChemCell documentation as the "style" of a particular command.

The instructions below for each category will list the header file for
the parent class that these styles are sub-classes of.  Public
variables in that file are ones used and set by the sub-classes which
are also used by the parent class.  Sometimes they are also used by
the rest of ChemCell.  Virtual functions in the header file which are
set = 0 are ones you must define in your new class to give it the
functionality ChemCell expects.  Virtual functions that are not set to 0
are functions you can optionally define.

Here are some additional guidelines for modifying ChemCell and adding
new functionality:

Think about whether what you want to do would be better as a pre- or
post-processing step.  Many computations are more easily and more
quickly done that way.

If you add something useful, send me an "email"_mail.  We might be
interested in adding it to the ChemCell distribution.

Region geometry options :link(region),h4

Classes that define simple geometric regions are sub-classes of the
Region class.  See the region.h file for a list of methods these
classes defines.  Regions are used in ChemCell to define surfaces
which particles diffuse between or on.

Region_sphere.cpp and region_sphere.h are the simplest example of a
Region class.  They implement the {sphere} style of the
"region"_region.html command.

Here is a brief description of the class methods required:

bbox: bounding box
inside: determine whether a point is in the region
hex_intersect: check if region surface intersects a hex cell
line_intersect: check if line segment intersects region surface
compute_normal: unit normal to region at a point
move2d: perform a 2d move on region surface
distance: compute distance from point to region surface :tb(s=:)

Fix options :link(fix),h4

In ChemCell, a "fix" is any operation that is computed during
timestepping that alters some property of the system.  Essentially
everything that happens during a simulation besides force computation,
neighbor list manipulation, and output, is a "fix".  This includes
time integration (update of velocity and coordinates), force
constraints (SHAKE or walls), and diagnostics (compute a diffusion
coefficient).  See the fix.h file for a list of methods these classes
defines.

There are dozens of fix options in ChemCell; choose one as a template
that is similar to what you want to implement.  They can be as simple
as zeroing out forces (see "fix enforce2d"_fix_enforce2d.html which
corresponds to the {enforce2d} style) or as complicated as applying
SHAKE constraints on bonds and angles (see "fix shake"_fix_shake.html
which corresponds to the {shake} style) which involves many extra
computations.

Here is a brief description of the class methods in fix.h:

setmask: determines when the fix is called during the timestep
init: initialization before a run
setup: called immediately before the 1st timestep
initial_integrate: called at very beginning of each timestep
pre_exchange: called before atom exchange on re-neighboring steps
pre_neighbor: called before neighbor list build
post_force: called after pair & molecular forces are computed
final_integrate: called at end of each timestep
end_of_step: called at very end of timestep
write_restart: dumps fix info to restart file
restart: uses info from restart file to re-initialize the fix
grow_arrays: allocate memory for atom-based arrays used by fix
copy_arrays: copy atom info when an atom migrates to a new processor
memory_usage: report memory used by fix
pack_exchange: store atom's data in a buffer
unpack_exchange: retrieve atom's data from a buffer
pack_restart: store atom's data for writing to restart file
unpack_restart: retrieve atom's data from a restart file buffer
size_restart: size of atom's data
maxsize_restart: max size of atom's data
initial_integrate_respa: same as initial_integrate, but for rRESPA
post_force_respa: same as post_force, but for rRESPA
final_integrate_respa: same as final_integrate, but for rRESPA
pack_comm: pack a buffer to communicate a per-atom quantity
unpack_comm: unpack a buffer to communicate a per-atom quantity
pack_reverse_comm: pack a buffer to reverse communicate a per-atom quantity
unpack_reverse_comm: unpack a buffer to reverse communicate a per-atom quantity
thermo_fields: define quantities for thermodynamic output
thermo_compute: compute thermodynamic quantities :tb(s=:)

Typically, only a small fraction of these methods are defined for a
particular fix.  Setmask is mandatory, as it determines when the fix
will be invoked during the timestep.  Fixes that perform time
integration ({nve}, {nvt}, {npt}) implement initial_integrate and
final_integrate to perform velocity Verlet updates.  Fixes that
constrain forces implement post_force.  Fixes that perform diagnostics
typically implement end_of_step.

If the fix needs to store information for each atom that persists from
timestep to timestep, it can manage that memory and migrate it with
the atoms as they move from processors to processor by implementing
the grow_arrays, copy_arrays, pack_exchange, and unpack_exchange
methods.  Similary, the pack_restart and unpack_restart methods can be
implemented to store information about the fix in restart files.  If
you wish a integrator or force constraint fix to work with rRESPA (see
the "run_style"_run_style.html command), the initial_integrate,
post_force_integrate, and final_integrate_respa methods can be
implemented.  The thermo_fields and thermo_compute methods enable a
fix to contribute values to thermodynamic output, as printed
quantities and/or to be summed to the potential energy of the system.

Atom options :link(atom),h4

All classes that define an atom style are sub-classes of the Atom
class.  See the atom.h file for a list of methods these classes
defines.  The atom style determines what quantities are associated
with an atom in a ChemCell simulation.  If one of the existing atom
styles does not define all the arrays you need to store with an atom,
then a new atom class can be created.

Atom_atomic.cpp and atom_atomic.h are the simplest example of an Atom
class.  They implement the {atomic} style of the
"atom_style"_atom_style.html command.

Here is a brief description of the class methods in atom.h:

copy: copy info for one atom to another atom's array location
pack_comm: store an atom's info in a buffer communicated every timestep
unpack_comm: retrieve an atom's info from the buffer
pack_reverse: store an atom's info in a buffer communicating partial forces
unpack_reverse: retrieve an atom's info from the buffer
pack_border: store an atom's info in a buffer communicated on neighbor re-builds
unpack_border: retrieve an atom's info from the buffer
pack_exchange: store all an atom's info to migrate to another processor
unpack_exchange: retrieve an atom's info from the buffer
:tb(s=:)

There are also several methods in atom.cpp you will need to augment
with information about your new atom class, following the patterns of
the other atom styles.  These routines are so similar for all classes,
that it was simpler to just have one master routine for all classes.

constructor: create style variable and atom array ptrs to NULL
destructor: free memory for atom arrays
set_style: set style variable
check_style: check for pure style vs hybrid style
style2arg: convert style variables to keywords
grow: re-allocate atom arrays to longer lengths
unpack_data: parse atom lines from data file
create_one: create an individual atom of this style
size_restart: number of restart quantities associated with proc's atoms
pack_restart: pack atom quantities into a buffer
unpack_restart: unpack atom quantities from a buffer
memory_usage: memory allocated by atom arrays
:tb(s=:)

New Top-level Commands :link(command),h4

It is possible to add a new command to a ChemCell input script as
opposed to adding a new style to an existing command (atom_style,
pair_style, fix, etc).  For example the create_atoms, read_data,
velocity, and run commands are all top-level ChemCell commands that are
listed in the Command section of style.h.  When such a command is
encountered in the ChemCell input script, the topmost level of ChemCell
(ChemCell.cpp) simply creates a class with the corresponding name,
invokes the "command" method of the class, and passes it the arguments
from the input script.  The command method can perform whatever
operations it wishes on the ChemCell data structures.

Thus to add a new command, you simply need to add a *.cpp and *.h file
containing a single class:

command: operations performed by the new command :tb(s=:)

Of course, the new class can define other methods and variables that
it uses internally.
