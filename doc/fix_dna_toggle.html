</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Adjust two reaction rates based on a DNA species which toggles on and
off.  This is a method for modeling the state of a DNA site as
occupied (on) by a transcription factor or unoccupied (off).  When
occupied, mRNA transcripts are produced at a transcription rate; when
unoccupied they are produced at a 2nd constitutive rate.
</P>
<P>Here is how the fix operates.  Assume a speciesDNA-ID is defined.
Also assume 2 reactions are defined.  The first is reactRNA-ID which
produces mRNA transcripts.  The second is reactDNA-ID which toggles
the DNA on and off.  They should be specified in the following form
where NULL means there are no reactants.  As discussed below, their
specified rates are ignored since the rates are set by this fix, so
they can be specified as 0.0.
</P>
<PRE>NULL -> mRNA
NULL -> speciesDNA-ID 
</PRE>
<PRE>reaction reactRNA-ID 0.0 mRNA-ID
reaction reactDNA-ID 0.0 speciesDNA-ID 
</PRE>
<P>Every N timesteps, two operations are performed.  First the
concentration or count of speciesDNA-ID is reset.  For continuum ODE
simulations it will be a continuous value between 0 and 1.  For
stochastic models, it will be a discrete count, either 0 or 1.  A
value of 0 represents an "off" or unbound state for the DNA, while 1
represents an "on" or bound state.  As discussed below, in stochastic
models, the 2nd reaction will potentially set the DNA count to 1 or 2;
the latter value will be changed to 0 by the fix.  I.e. the DNA
toggles on or off.
</P>
<P>Second, the rates of the 2 reactions are reset in the following way.
The rate of the 1st reaction is set to be
</P>
<PRE>Knew = Ktranscription * Koff/Kon * DNA + Kconstitutive * (1 - DNA) 
</PRE>
<P>Ktranscription and Kconstitutive are the parameters specified in the
fix command, as are Koff and Kon.  Ktranscription is the rate at which
mRNA is produced when the transcription factor is bound to the DNA
site.  Kconstitutive is the native rate mRNA is produced when the DNA
site is unbound.  Koff/Kon has units of molarity and represents an
average concentration.  DNA is a unitless number between 0 and 1.  The
units of both terms and thus the overall rate Knew is molarity/sec
which is the rate at which the mRNA species in the 1st reaction will
be produced.
</P>
<P>The rate of the 2nd reaction is set to be
</P>
<PRE>Knew = sign * Koff * DNA + Kon * [bind-ID] * (1 - DNA) 
</PRE>
<P>Koff, Kon, and DNA are as above.  [bind-ID] is the concentration of
the transcription factor species which binds to the DNA site.  The
units of Knew are thus per second which is the rate at which the DNA
toggles its state.
</P>
<P>Sign is set to a value of -1 for continuum ODE models.  This is what
keeps the value of DNA between 0 and 1.  Sign is set to +1 for
stochastic models.  If this reaction is performed when DNA is on
(value of 1), then the DNA count will increase from 1 to 2, and be
reset to 0 on the subsequent timestep as described above.  Thus the
DNA will effectively be turned off.
