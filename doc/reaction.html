reaction ID reactant1 reactant2 K product1 product2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID = user-assigned name for the reaction

<LI>K = reaction rate (see units below)
<LI>productN = species-IDs of zero or more products

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a reaction that turns reactants into products at a specified
reaction rate.  The reaction can have zero, one, or two reactants and
0 or more products.
</P>
<P>The ID of a reaction can contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores and dashes.
</P>
<P>The species-IDs of all reactants and products must have been
previously defined using the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command.
</P>
<P>The units of the reaction rate K are molarity/sec for reactions with 0
reactants, 1/sec for unary reactions, and 1/molarity-sec for binary
reactions.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "react_modify.html">react_modify</A> command can be used to specify
the spatial location of created products as well as other reaction
attributes.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Reactions with 0 reactants can only be specified for non-spatial
simulations.
</P>
<P>The maximum number of product species for any one reaction is
hard-wired in src/react.cpp via the MAX_PRODUCT setting.  Currently it
is set to 5.
