permeable command :h3

[Syntax:]

permeable species-ID surface-ID flag keyword value ... :pre

species-ID = ID of particle species :ulb,l
surface=ID = ID of region or triangulated surface :l
flag = {in} or {out} or {both} :l
one or more keyword/value pairs can be specified :l
  keywords = {reflect} or {near} or {stick} or {far} or {thru} or \
             {rsp} or {nsp} or {ssp} or {fsp} or {tsp}
  {reflect}, {near}, {stick}, {far}, {thru} value = probability
    probability = value between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive)
  {rsp}, {nsp}, {ssp}, {fsp}, {tsp} value = species-ID
    species-ID = what particle will become if event takes place :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

permeable A nucleus out reflect 0.9 thru 0.1 tsp A_nuc
permeable Ca_cyto cell reflect 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

Set the permeability for a species when it encounters a surface
(region or triangulated surface) during a move.  The flag value
in/out/both refers to which side of the surface.  Each triangle in a
triangulated surface has an "outside" determined by applying the
right-hand rule to its 3 ordered vertices.

Each time a 3d particle hits a surface, there are 5 possibilities.  It
can reflect off and continue its move, end its move by being placed
EPSILON away from the surface on the near side, stick to the surface
and become a 2d species, end its move by being placed EPSILON away
from the surface on the far side, or pass thru the surface unimpeded.

Each of the 5 cases is assigned a fractional probability P, the sum of
which must be 1.0.  When a particle moves and a surface is struck, a
random number is generated which is used to select which of the 5
cases occurs.

Each of the 5 surface interactions will also cause the particle to
become a new species, if the corresponding keyword
(rsp,nsp,ssp,fsp,tsp) is specified.

[Restrictions:]

This command cannot be used for 2d species.  If the stick probability
is non-zero, the {ssp} keyword must be specified, else the 3d species
cannot become a 2d species.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

By default, all 3d species have a reflection probability of 1.0 with
all surfaces with no species change.
