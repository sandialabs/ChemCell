move_test command :h3

[Syntax:]

move_test species-ID N Nhisto seed file :pre

species-ID = ID of species
N = # of moves
Nhisto = number of histogram bins
seed = random # seed
file = file to write results to :ul

[Examples:]

move_test Ca 10000 100 58327 tmp.diff :pre

[Description:]

Test the diffusive movement of a species by performing N moves of a
single particle, and binning the result in distance.  The histogram
statistics are written to the specified file.

This is useful to test the distribution of move distances for a
particular diffusion coefficient and timestep size.
