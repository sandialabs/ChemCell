<H3>triangles command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>triangles surf-ID M N 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>surf-ID = user-assigned name for triangulated surface
<LI>M = number of vertices that follow
<LI>N = number of triangles and edge connections that follow 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>triangles cell 150 100
triangles ER 27000 16000 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a surface with M vertices and N triangles from successive lines
of the input script.  If surf-ID already exists, the new triangles are
added to it.  If it doesn't exist, a new surface is created with
default permeability settings for all species.
</P>
<P>The ID of a surface can contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores and dashes.
</P>
<P>Following the triangles command, the next line in the input script is
skipped (leave it blank).  3 sections of information follow, separated
by blank lines.
</P>
<P>The first section has M vertex lines, each with an index (1-M) and 3
coordinates (x,y,z in microns).
</P>
<P>The second section has N lines, each with an index (1-N) and 3 integer
vertex indices (1-M) which define the corner points of each triangle.
The 3 indices should be ordered so that applying the right-hand rule
yields a normal vector pointing in the "outward" direction from the
triangle face.
</P>
<P>The third section has an index (1-N) followed by 6 integers: i ei j ej
k ek.  I,J,K are the 3 triangles this triangle is connected to across
its 3 edges where its 1st edge is between vertices 1-2, its 2nd edge
is between 2-3, and its 3rd edge is between 3-1.  I,J,K are integer
values between 1-N.  Ei,Ej,Ek is the edge (1-3) on the other triangle
that this edge is connected to.  If a triangle has no connection
across a particular edge, than the 2 associated values (e.g. I,Ei)
should be 0.
</P>
<P>Note that a long list of triangles can be put in a separate file and
read in via the <A HREF = "include.html">include</A> command.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "bin.html">bin command</A> must be used before defining a triangulated
surface.
