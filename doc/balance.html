<H3>balance command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<P>balance style arg(s) file
</P>
<LI>style = <I>static</I> or <I>dynamic</I> 

<PRE>  <I>static</I> args: <I>bin</I> or <I>particle</I>
    bin = balance by bin count
    particle = balance by particle count
  <I>dynamic</I> args: N threshhold
    N = test whether to balance every N steps
    threshhold = only balance if imbalance is greater than threshhold
file = optional filename for storing sub-domain boundaries 
</PRE>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>bin static particle
bin dynamic 1000 1.5 out.file 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>For parallel runs of spatial simulations, determine how bins are
partitioned across processors.
</P>
<P>If this command is not used, the set of 3d bins are partitioned into
small 3d bricks, one per processor.
</P>
<P>If "static bin" is used, bins are partitioned by recursive coordinate
bisectioning (RCB) one time at the beginning of the 1st run.  Each bin
is weighted the same, no matter how many particles it contains.
</P>
<P>If "static particle" is used, bins are partitioned by recursive
coordinate bisectioning (RCB) at the beginning of each run.  Each bin
is weighted by the number of particles it contains.
</P>
<P>If "dynamic" is used, bins are re-partitioned every N timesteps, with
each bin weighting by their current number of particles.
Re-partitioning only occurs if the imbalance factor exceeds the
specfied threshhold.  The imbalance factor is the ratio of the maximum
particles on any processor divided by the average particles across all
processors, so an imbalance factor or 1.0 is perfect balance.
</P>
<P>File is an optional argument.  If specified the load balance
partitions are written to the file each time the balancer is invoked,
formatted as a surface of triangles which can be visualized with
the <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py toolkit</A>.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
