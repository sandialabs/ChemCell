<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>permeable species-ID surface-ID flag keyword value ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>species-ID = ID of particle species 

<LI>surface-ID = ID of region or triangulated surface 

<LI>flag = <I>in</I> or <I>out</I> or <I>both</I> 

<LI>one or more keyword/value pairs can be specified 

<PRE>  keywords = <I>reflect</I> or <I>near</I> or <I>stick</I> or <I>far</I> or <I>thru</I> or <I>rsp</I> or <I>nsp</I> or <I>ssp</I> or <I>fsp</I> or <I>tsp</I>
  <I>reflect</I>, <I>near</I>, <I>stick</I>, <I>far</I>, <I>thru</I> value = probability
    probability = value between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive)
  <I>rsp</I>, <I>nsp</I>, <I>ssp</I>, <I>fsp</I>, <I>tsp</I> value = species-ID
    species-ID = what the permeating particle will become if event takes place

<PRE>permeable A nucleus out reflect 0.9 thru 0.1 tsp A_nuc
permeable Ca_cyto cell reflect 1.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the permeability for a species when it encounters a surface
(region or triangulated surface) during a move.  The <I>flag</I> value
in/out/both refers to which side of the surface.  Each triangle in a
triangulated surface has an "outside" determined by applying the
right-hand rule to its 3 ordered vertices.
</P>
<P>Each time a 3d particle hits a surface, there are 5 possibilities.  It
can reflect off and continue its move, end its move by being placed
EPSILON away from the surface on the near side, stick to the surface
and become a 2d species, end its move by being placed EPSILON away
from the surface on the far side, or pass thru the surface unimpeded.
</P>
<P>Each of the 5 cases is assigned a fractional probability P, the sum of
which must be 1.0.  When a particle moves and a surface is
encountered, a random number is generated which is used to select
which of the 5 cases occurs.
</P>
<P>Each of the 5 surface interactions can also cause the particle to
become a new species, if the corresponding keyword
(rsp,nsp,ssp,fsp,tsp) is specified.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command cannot be used for 2d species.  If the stick probability
is non-zero, the <I>ssp</I> keyword must be specified, else the 3d species
cannot become a 2d species.
</P>
<P>This command can only be used for spatial simulations.
</P>
<P><B>Related commands:</B> none
</P>
<P><B>Default:</B>
</P>
<P>By default, all 3d species interact with all surfaces with a
reflection probability of 1.0 and with no species change.
