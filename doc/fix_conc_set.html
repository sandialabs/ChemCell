<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the concentration level of certain species at specified time
increments in a non-spatial simulation.  This is an effective way of
coupling ChemCell to another model or simulation that pre-computed
concentration vs time profiles of certain species.
</P>
<P>Here is how the fix operates.  Every N timesteps, the concentration or
count of particles of each species in the specified list is reset to a
new value which is listed in the time-course data file, which has the
following format.  Lines beginning with a "#" character are ignored.
Other lines must begin with a time value (in seconds), followed by Nsp
values.  The time stamp for successive lines in the file should be
monotonically increasing.  For stochastic simulations (Gillespie), the
value for each species is a particle count.  For continuum simulations
(ODE), the value for each species is a concentration in molarity.
</P>
<P>On a timestep when the fix is applied, the file line with a time stamp
just smaller (or equal) to the current time is used to set the species
concentrations.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix can only be used with non-spatial simulations.
