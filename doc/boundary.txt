boundary command :h3

[Syntax:]

boundary x y z :pre

x,y,z = {p} or {n} :l
  {p} is periodic
  {n} is non-periodic :pre

[Examples:]

boundary p p n :pre

[Description:]

Set the periodicity of the global domain in each of the x,y,z
dimensions.  "N" means the domain is non-periodic in that dimension,
so that if particles move outside the domain, they are lost.  "P"
means the domain is periodic in that dimension, so particles
wrap-around to the other size and can react with nearby particles
across the periodic boundary.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"global"_global.html

[Default:]

All dimensions are periodic.
