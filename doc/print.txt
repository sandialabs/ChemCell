print command :h3

[Syntax:]

print string :pre

string = text string to print, which may contain variables :ul

[Examples:]

print "Done with equilibration"
print "The system volume is now $v" :pre

[Description:]

Print a text string to the screen and logfile.  The text string must
be a single argument, so it should be enclosed in double quotes if it
is more than one word.  If variables are included in the string, they
will be evaluated and their current values printed.

If you want the print command to be executed multiple times (with
changing variable values) then the print command could appear in a
section of the input script that is looped over (see the
"jump"_jump.html and "next"_next.html commands).

See the "variable"_variable.html command for a description of {equal}
style variables which are typically the most useful ones to use with
the print command.  Equal-style variables can calculate formulas
involving mathematical operations, or references to other
"variables"_variable.html.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

[Default:] none
