<H3>write_restart command

<P><B>Syntax:</B>

<UL><LI>file = name of file to write restart information to 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>write_restart restart.equil 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Write a binary restart file of the current state of the simulation.
Only particle information is stored in a restart file.
</P>
<P>During a long simulation, the <A HREF = "restart.html">restart</A> command is
typically used to dump restart files periodically.  The write_restart
command is useful between simulations or whenever you wish to write
out a single current restart file.
</P>
<P>Restart files can be read by a <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
command to restart a simulation from a particular state.  Because the
file is binary (to enable exact restarts), it may not be readable on
another machine.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used for spatial simulations.
