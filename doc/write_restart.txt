write_restart command :h3

[Syntax:]

write_restart file :pre

file = name of file to write restart information to :ul

[Examples:]

write_restart restart.equil :pre

[Description:]

Write a binary restart file of the current state of the simulation.
Only particle information is stored in a restart file.

During a long simulation, the "restart"_restart.html command is
typically used to dump restart files periodically.  The write_restart
command is useful between simulations or whenever you wish to write
out a single current restart file.

Restart files can be read by a "read_restart"_read_restart.html
command to restart a simulation from a particular state.  Because the
file is binary (to enable exact restarts), it may not be readable on
another machine.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used for spatial simulations.

[Related commands:]

"restart"_restart.html, "read_restart"_read_restart.html

[Default:] none
