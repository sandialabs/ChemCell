ChemCell Documentation :c,h3
27 May 2011 :c,h4

Version info: :h4

The ChemCell "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 May
2010. ChemCell is updated continuously.  Whenever we fix a bug or add
a feature, we release it immediately, and post a notice on "this page
of the WWW site"_bug.  Each dated copy of ChemCell contains all the
features and bug-fixes up to and including that version date. The
version date is printed to the screen and logfile every time you run
ChemCell. It is also in the file src/version.h and in the ChemCell
directory name created when you unpack a tarball.

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the ChemCell WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of ChemCell. :ulb,l

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages included in your tarball, they
describe the version you have. :ule,l

ChemCell is a particle-based reaction/diffusion simulator designed for
modeling protein networks in biological cells with spatial
information.  Compartments within the cell are bounded by membrane
surfaces defined as geometric regions or connected triangles.
Particles represent individual biomolecules and diffuse via Brownian
motion in 3d and on 2d surfaces.  Particles react with neighboring
particles according to rules derived from chemical rate equations.
Non-spatial models can also be run using an ODE solver or the
Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA).  Spatial simulations
can be run in parallel as can multiple instances of non-spatial
simluations for statistical averaging.  The "Pizza.py package"_pizza
of Python-based tools can create input files for ChemCell and
visualize and plot its output.

ChemCell was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US
Department of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE.  It is an
open-source code, designed to be easy to modify and extend with new
functionality.  It is distributed freely under the terms of the GNU
Public License (GPL).

The authors of the code are "Steve Plimpton"_sjp and Alex Slepoy, who
can be contacted at sjplimp at sandia.gov and alexander.sleopy at
nnsa.doe.gov.  The "ChemCell WWW Site"_cws at
http://chemcell.sandia.gov has more information about the code and its
uses.
