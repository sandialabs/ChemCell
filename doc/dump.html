<H3>dump command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>dump ID N filename species1-ID species2-ID ...
dump ID delta filename species1-ID species2-ID ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID = user-assigned name for the dump
<LI>N = dump particles every N timesteps (integer value)
<LI>delta = dump particles every delta seconds (floating point value)
<LI>filename = file to dump to
<LI>speciesN-ID = optional list of species-IDs to dump to file 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>dump 1 100 tmp.dump
dump Ca-dump 0.1 tmp.dump.Ca Ca-cyto Ca-ER 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Dump a snapshot of particle coordinates and species types to a file
every so often as a simulation runs.  The species list is optional; if
not specified, all particles are dumped.
</P>
<P>The ID of a dump can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
</P>
<P>The frequency of output can be specied in timesteps or elapsed
simulation time.  Using an integer versus a floating-point value (with
a decimal point) determines how the argument is interpreted.
</P>
<P>Any species-ID can contain a single wildcard character * which will
match species and alias names in the usual way.  E.g. a species-ID can
be *, ab*, *ab, ab*cd.
</P>
<P>Multiple dumps (with different IDs) can be defined.  See the
<A HREF = "undump.html">undump</A> command for turning off a dump.
</P>
<P>The format of the dump file is self-explanatory.  For each particle,
an ID, its species type (an an integer), and its x,y,z coordinates are
printed.  Dump files can be visualized with the <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py
toolkit</A> or converted into other formats (via Pizza.py) suitable
for visualization with other tools, e.g. <A HREF = "http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd">VMD</A>.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
