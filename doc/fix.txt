fix command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID style args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the fix
style = style name of fix (see possible styles below)
args = arguments used by a particular style :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 conc 100 data.file 2 CheA CheAa 2 CheAa CheA :pre

[Description:]

Set a fix that will be applied during a simulation.  In ChemCell, a
"fix" is any operation that is applied to the system during
timestepping.  Examples include adjusting reaction rates, applying
boundary conditions, or computing diagnostics.  There is currently
only a small number of fixes defined in ChemCell, but others can be
added - see "this section"_Section_modify.html of the documentation
for a discussion.

Each fix style has its own documentation page which describes its
arguments and what it does.  For example, see the "fix
conc"_fix_conc.html page for information on style {conc}.

Fixes perform their operations at different stages of the timestep.
If 2 or more fixes both operate at the same stage of the timestep,
they are invoked in the order they were specified in the input script.

Specifying a new fix with the same ID as an existing fix effectively
replaces the old fix (and its parameters) with the new fix.  This can
only be done if the new fix has the same style as the existing fix.

Fixes can be deleted with the "unfix"_unfix.html command.  Note that
this is the only way to turn off a fix; simply specifying a new fix
with a similar style will not turn off the first one.

Here is an alphabetic list of fix styles currently defined in ChemCell:

"fix conc/random"_fix_conc_random.html - set the concentration of one or more species
"fix conc/set"_fix_conc_set.html - set the concentration of one or more species
"fix dna/toggle"_fix_dna_toggle.html - model DNA toggling on/off to modulate mRNA production
"fix rate/saturate"_fix_rate_saturate.html - adjust the rate of one or more reactions :ul

[Restrictions:] none
