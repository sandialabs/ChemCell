<H3>move_style command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>move_style option1 option2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>options = <I>cube</I> or <I>sphere</I> or <I>square</I> or <I>circle</I> or <I>uniform</I> or <I>brownian</I>

<P><B>Examples:</B>

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set one or more options that determine how particles move in a spatial
simulation.
</P>
<P>The <I>cube</I> option means particle will sample points in a small cube
around their locations.  The <I>sphere</I> option means particles will
sample points in a small sphere around their location.
</P>
<P>The <I>square</I> option means particles will only move in 2d and sample
points in a small xy square around their locations.  The <I>cirlce</I>
option means particles will only move in 2d and samples points in a
small xy circle around their locations.  These options can be used
with a <A HREF = "global.html">global</A> simulation domain that is small in the
z-dimension to effectively setup a 2d simulation.
</P>
<P>The <I>uniform</I> option means the sampling of volumetric (or planar)
space is uniform.  The <I>brownian</I> option means the sampling is from a
Gaussian so that particles move in Brownian motion.
</P>
<P>For 2d particles diffusing on regions or triangulated surfaces, only
the uniform/brownian options are relevant since particles always
effectively move in 2d, sampling within a circle tangential to the
surface.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used for spatial simulations.

<P><B>Default:</B>
</P>
<P>The default move style is cube brownian.
