fix conc/random command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID conc/random N file Nin insp1 insp2 ... Nout outsp1 outsp2 ... :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command
conc/random = style name of this fix command
N = apply fix every this many timesteps
file = filename in which time course data is specified
Nin = # of input species
insp1,insp2,etc = IDs of input species
Nout = # of output species
outsp1,outsp2,etc = IDs of output species :ul

[Examples:]

fix mine conc/random 100 data.time 2 CheA CheAa 2 CheAa CheA :pre

[Description:]

Randomize the species type of certain particles at specified time
increments in a spatial simulation.  This is an effective way of
coupling ChemCell to another model or simulation that produced
concentration vs time profiles of certain species.

Here is how the fix operates.  Every N timesteps, the list of current
particles is scanned.  Each partice with a species type in the list of
Nin input species has its species type reset to a new value which is
one of the Nout output species.  Each of the Nout species has a
fractional probability associated with it (between 0.0 and 1.0), which
sum to 1.0.  The assignment of a particle to a new species is done
randomly, in accord with those probabilities.

The probabilities for new species can be time-dependent and are
read-in from the time course data file, which has the following
format.  Lines beginning with a "#" character are ignored.  Other
lines must begin with a time value (in seconds), followed by Nout-1
values (between 0.0 and 1.0) which sum to a value <= 1.0.  These are
the probabilities for each of the Nout species.  The value for the
last Nout species is 1.0 - sum.  The time stamp for successive lines
in the file should be monotonically increasing.

On a timestep when the fix is applied, the file line with a time stamp
just smaller (or equal) to the current time is used to set the Nout
probabilities.

[Restrictions:]

This fix can only be used with spatial simulations.
