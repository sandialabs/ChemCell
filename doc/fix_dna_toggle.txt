fix dna/toggle command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID dna/toggle N speciesDNA-ID Kon Koff reactRNA-ID Ktranscription Kconstitutive reactDNA-ID bind-ID Vratio :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command
dna/toggle = style name of this fix command
N = apply fix every this many timesteps
speciesDNA-ID = ID of DNA species
Kon = rate at which DNA is turned on (per second per molarity)
Koff = rate at which DNA is turned off (per second)
reactRNA-ID = ID of reaction which produces mRNA transcripts
Ktranscription = transcription rate at which mRNA is produced (per second per molarity)
Kconstitutive = constitutive rate at which mRNA is produced (molarity per second)
reactDNA-ID = ID of reaction which represents DNA on/off state
bind-ID = ID of transcription species which binds to DNA
Vratio = volume ratio to use as scale factor on bind-ID concentration :ul

[Examples:]

fix mine dna/toggle 1 DNA 2.0e5 0.02 RNA-reac 100.0 0.1 DNA-reac NFkB-nuc 10.0 :pre

[Description:]

Adjust two reaction rates based on a DNA species which toggles on and
off.  This is a method for modeling the state of a DNA site as
occupied (on) by a transcription factor or unoccupied (off).  When
occupied, mRNA transcripts are produced at a transcription rate; when
unoccupied they are produced at a 2nd constitutive rate.

Here is how the fix operates.  Assume a speciesDNA-ID is defined.
Also assume 2 reactions are defined.  The first is reactRNA-ID which
produces mRNA transcripts.  The second is reactDNA-ID which toggles
the DNA on and off.  They should be specified in the following form
where NULL means there are no reactants.  As discussed below, their
specified rates are ignored since the rates are set by this fix, so
they can be specified as 0.0.

NULL -> mRNA
NULL -> speciesDNA-ID :pre

reaction reactRNA-ID 0.0 mRNA-ID
reaction reactDNA-ID 0.0 speciesDNA-ID :pre

Every N timesteps, two operations are performed.  First the
concentration or count of speciesDNA-ID is reset.  For continuum ODE
simulations it will be a continuous value between 0 and 1.  For
stochastic models, it will be a discrete count, either 0 or 1.  A
value of 0 represents an "off" or unbound state for the DNA, while 1
represents an "on" or bound state.  As discussed below, in stochastic
models, the 2nd reaction will potentially set the DNA count to 1 or 2;
the latter value will be changed to 0 by the fix.  I.e. the DNA
toggles on or off.

Second, the rates of the 2 reactions are reset in the following way.
The rate of the 1st reaction is set to be

Knew = Ktranscription * Koff/Kon * DNA + Kconstitutive * (1 - DNA) :pre

Ktranscription and Kconstitutive are the parameters specified in the
fix command, as are Koff and Kon.  Ktranscription is the rate at which
mRNA is produced when the transcription factor is bound to the DNA
site.  Kconstitutive is the native rate mRNA is produced when the DNA
site is unbound.  Koff/Kon has units of molarity and represents an
average concentration.  DNA is a unitless number between 0 and 1.  The
units of both terms and thus the overall rate Knew is molarity/sec
which is the rate at which the mRNA species in the 1st reaction will
be produced.

The rate of the 2nd reaction is set to be

Knew = sign * Koff * DNA + Kon * \[bind-ID\] * (1 - DNA) :pre

Koff, Kon, and DNA are as above.  \[bind-ID\] is the concentration of
the transcription factor species which binds to the DNA site.  This
concentration will be boosted by Vratio if you need to account for the
fact that the transcription factor species is in a smaller-volume
compartment, e.g. the nucleus.  This is only relevant for stochastic
models since the concentration should already be scaled appopriately
in an ODE model.  The units of Knew are thus per second which is the
rate at which the DNA toggles its state.

Sign is set to a value of -1 for continuum ODE models.  This is what
keeps the value of DNA between 0 and 1.  Sign is set to +1 for
stochastic models.  If this reaction is performed when DNA is on
(value of 1), then the DNA count will increase from 1 to 2, and be
reset to 0 on the subsequent timestep as described above.  Thus the
DNA will effectively be turned off.

[Restrictions:]

This fix can only be used with non-spatial simulations.
