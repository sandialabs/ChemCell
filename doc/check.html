<H3>check command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<P>check species-ID surf-ID flag lo hi plo phi
</P>
<P>species-ID = particle species to check
surf-ID = surface to check
flag = <I>in</I> or <I>out</I> or <I>none</I>
lo,hi = optional timestep bounds
plo,phi = optional particle index bounds
</P>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>check Ca_cyto ER_surf out 1000 2000 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Check particles of species-ID to see if they are inside or outside of
the surface with surf-ID.  A warning will be printed if a particle
does not satisfy the check condition.  This can be useful for testing
if particles have leaked thru a boundary they shouldn't have.
</P>
<P>The flag determines whether the check is for the particles being
inside or outside the surface.  A value of <I>none</I> means do not perform
the check.  This command can be used multiple times to specify
combinations of particle species and surfaces to check.
</P>
<P>The surf-ID is assumed to be a closed set of triangles or closed
region.  Performing a check for a triangulated surface is expensive;
all triangles are looped over for each particle.
</P>
<P>Lo/hi are optional timestep values between which (inclusive) the check
is done.  If not specified, a check is performed every timestep.
</P>
<P>Plo/phi are optional particle indices (0 to N-1) to specify a subset
of particles (inclusive) to perform the check on.  If not specified
all particles (of the specified species) are checked.  Note that lo/hi
must be specified in order to also specify plo/phi.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Only 3d particles can be checked.
</P>
<P><B>Related commands:</B> none

<P><B>Default:</B>

<P>No particle-surface checks are performed.
