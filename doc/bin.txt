bin command :h3

[Syntax:]

bin keyword value(s) ... :pre

one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
valid keywords: {diff} or {react} or {size} or {count} :l
  {diff} value = D
    D = diffusion coeff (cm^2/sec)
  {react} value = dist
    dist = distance (microns)
  {size} values = Lx Ly Lz
    Lx,Ly,Lz = bin sizes in each dimension (microns)
  {count} values = Nx Ny Ny
    Nx,Ny,Nz = bin count in each dimension :pre

[Examples:]

bin diff 1.0e-8
bin react 0.02 diff 1.0e-7
bin count 30 35 40

[Description:]

Create a set of bins that overlay the simulation domain.  Bins are
used for storing the location of particles and geometry elements
(regions, surface triangles) so they can be efficiently located.

Bin size is determined by one or more keyword/value pairs.  The actual
bin size is set to the maximum of the values induced by each keyword.

The {diff} keyword sets the bin size to the maximum distance a
particle will move in one timestep using the specified D and the
"timestep"_timestep.html and "move_style"_move_style.html settings.
You may need to run ChemCell once to see the move distances printed
out at setup.

The {react} keyword sets the bin size by the specified distance,
assumed to be the largest distance at which a binary reaction between
2 particles will occur.  You may need to run ChemCell once to see the
reaction distances printed out at setup.

The {size} keyword sets the bin size in each dimension to the
specified values.

The {count} keyword sets the # of bins in each dimension to the
specified values.

Since the global domain is sub-divided by an integer # of bins in each
dimension, the actual bin size chosen may be slightly larger than the
values determined by the {diff}, {react}, or {size} keywords.

[Restrictions:] 

This command can only be used for spatial simulations.

The "global"_global.html command must be used before this command, to
specify the extent of the spatial simulation domain.
