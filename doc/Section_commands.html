<H3>3. Commands

<P>This section describes how a ChemCell input script is formatted and what
commands are used to define a ChemCell simulation.

<A NAME = "3_1"></A><H4>3.1 ChemCell input script 
</H4>
<P>ChemCell executes by reading commands from a input script (text file),
one line at a time.  When the input script ends, ChemCell exits.  Each
command causes ChemCell to take some action.  It may set an internal
variable, read in a file, or run a simulation.  Most commands have
default settings, which means you only need to use the command if you
wish to change the default.
</P>
<P>In many cases, the ordering of commands in an input script is not
important.  However the following rules apply:
</P>
<P>(1) ChemCell does not read your entire input script and then perform a
simulation with all the settings.  Rather, the input script is read
one line at a time and each command takes effect when it is read.
Thus this sequence of commands:
</P>
<PRE>stats	 10
run      100 
run      100 
</PRE>
<P>does something different than this sequence:
</P>
<PRE>run      100 
stats	 10
run      100 
</PRE>
<P>In the first case, statistics are printed every 10 timesteps during
two simulations of 100 timesteps each.  In the 2nd case, the default
statistics setting (0) is used for the 1st 100 step simulation and the
setting of 10 is used for the 2nd one.  Thus statistics during the 1st
run will only be printed at the beginning and end or the run.
</P>
<P>(2) Some commands are only valid when they follow other commands.  For
example you cannot setup a reaction until the particle species it
specifies have been defined.
</P>
<P>(3) Sometimes command B will use values that can be set by command A.
This means command A must precede command B in the input script if it
is to have the desired effect.  For example, the
<A HREF = "particles.html">particles</A> command reads a group of particles and
assigns them random numbers using a random number generator.  If
default values are not desired, the <A HREF = "seed.html">seed</A> command must be
used before particles to tell ChemCell how to initialize the random
number generator.
</P>
<P>Many input script errors are detected by ChemCell and an ERROR or
WARNING message is printed.  <A HREF = "Section_errors.html">This section</A> gives
more information on what errors mean.  The documentation for each
command lists restrictions on how the command can be used.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "3_2"></A><H4>3.2 Parsing rules 
</H4>
<P>Each non-blank line in the input script is treated as a command.
ChemCell commands are case sensitive.  Command names are lower-case, as
are specified command arguments.  Upper case letters may be used in
file names or user-chosen ID strings.
</P>
<P>Here is how each line in the input script is parsed by ChemCell:
</P>
<P>(1) If the line ends with a "&" character (with no trailing
whitespace), the command is assumed to continue on the next line.  The
next line is concatenated to the previous line by removing the "&"
character and newline.  This allows long commands to be continued
across two or more lines.
</P>
<P>(2) All characters from the first "#" character onward are treated as
comment and discarded.
</P>
<P>(3) The line is searched repeatedly for $ characters.  If the
character following the $ is "a" to "z", the two-characters sequence
(e.g. $x) is replaced with the corresponding variable text.  See the
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>(4) The line is broken into "words" separated by whitespace (tabs,
spaces).  Note that words can thus contain letters, digits,
underscores, or punctuation characters.
</P>
<P>(5) The first word is the command name.  All successive words in the
line are arguments.
</P>
<P>(6) Text with spaces can be enclosed in double quotes so it will be
treated as a single argument.  See the <A HREF = "fix_print.html">fix print</A>
command for an example.  A '#' or '$' charater in text between double
quotes will also not be treated as a comment or substituted for as a
variable.
</P>

<H4><A NAME = "3_3"></A>3.3 Input script structure 
</H4>
<P>This section describes the structure of a typical ChemCell input script.
The "examples" directory in the ChemCell distribution contains many
sample input scripts; the corresponding problems are discussed in
<A HREF = "Section_example.html">this section</A>, and animated on the <A HREF = "lws">ChemCell WWW
Site</A>.
</P>
<P>A ChemCell input script typically has several stages:
</P>
<OL><LI>Initialization
<LI>Define bins
<LI>Define geometry
<LI>Define particles
<LI>Define reactions
<LI>Settings
<LI>Run a simulation 
</OL>
<P>The last 2 stages can be repeated as many times as desired.  I.e. run
a simulation, change some settings, run some more, etc.  The "Define
bins" and "Define geometry" stages are not used for non-spatial
(Gillespie) simulations.  Each of the stages is now described in
more detail.  Remember that almost all the commands need only be used
if a non-default value is desired.
</P>
<P>(1) Initialization
</P>
<P>Set parameters that are typically defined before the simulation domain
is binned.
</P>
<P>The relevant commands are <A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style</A>,
<A HREF = "global.html">global</A>, <A HREF = "volume.html">volume</A>, <A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A>,
<A HREF = "seed.html">seed</A>, <A HREF = "timestep.html">timestep</A>,
<A HREF = "move_style.html">move_style</A>.
</P>
<P>(2) Define bins
</P>
<P>For spatial simulations, the simulation domain is partitioned into 3d
bins using the <A HREF = "bin.html">bin</A> command.  This must be done before
geometric objects or particles are created or read-in.
</P>
<P>(3) Define geometry
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "triangles.html">triangles</A> and <A HREF = "region.html">region</A> commands are
used to create geometric objects and membrane boundaries.
</P>
<P>(4) Define particles
</P>
<P>Particles and their attributes are created and set via these
commands:
</P>
<P><A HREF = "species.html">species</A>, <A HREF = "dimension.html">dimension</A>,
<A HREF = "diffusion.html">diffusion</A>, <A HREF = "count.html">count</A>,
<A HREF = "permeable.html">permeable</A>, <A HREF = "particles.html">particles</A>,
<A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
</P>
<P>(5) Define reactions
</P>
<P>Reactions (zero-order, unary, binary) are defined via the
<A HREF = "reaction.html">reaction</A>, <A HREF = "react_modify.html">react_modify</A>, and
<A HREF = "probability.html">probability</A> commands.
</P>
<P>(6) Settings
</P>
<P>Before a simulation is run, a variety of settings can be specified
using these commands:
</P>
<P><A HREF = "balance.html">balance</A>, <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A>, <A HREF = "stats.html">stats</A>,
<A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A>, <A HREF = "restart.html">restart</A>
</P>
<P>(7) Run a simulation
</P>
<P>A reaction/diffusion or Gillespie simulation is run using the
<A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
</P>
