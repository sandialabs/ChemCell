</H4>
<P>When you download ChemCell you will need to unzip and untar the
downloaded file with the following commands, after placing the file in
an appropriate directory.
</P>
<PRE>gunzip ChemCell*.tar.gz 
tar xvf ChemCell*.tar 
</PRE>
<P>This will create a ChemCell directory containing two files and several

<H4><A NAME = "2_2"></A>2.2 Making ChemCell 
</H4>
<P><B><I>Read this first:</I></B>
</P>
<P>Building ChemCell can be non-trivial.  You will likely need to edit a
makefile, there are compiler options, additional libraries can be used
(MPI, Zoltan), etc.  Please read this section carefully.  If you are
not comfortable with makefiles, or building codes on a Unix platform,
or running an MPI job on your machine, please find a local expert to
help you.
</P>
<P>If you have a build problem that you are convinced is a ChemCell issue
(e.g. the compiler complains about a line of ChemCell source code),
then please send an email to sjplimp@sandia.gov.  Note that doesn't
include linking problems - that's a question for a local expert!
</P>
<P>Also, if you succeed in building ChemCell on a new kind of machine
(for which there isn't a similar Makefile in src/MAKE), send it to
sjplimp@sandia.gov and we'll include it in future ChemCell releases.
</P>
<P><B><I>Building a ChemCell executable:</I></B>
</P>
<P>The src directory contains the C++ source and header files for ChemCell.
It also contains a top-level Makefile and a MAKE directory with
low-level Makefile.* files for several machines.  From within the src
directory, type "make" or "gmake".  You should see a list of available
choices.  If one of those is the machine and options you want, you can
type a command like:
</P>
<PRE>make linux
gmake mac 
</PRE>
<P>If you get no errors and an executable like ccell_linux or ccell_mac
is produced, you're done; it's your lucky day.  The remainder of this
section addresses the following topics: errors that occur when making
ChemCell, editing a new low-level Makefile.foo, and additional build
tips.
</P>
<P><B><I>Errors that occur when making ChemCell:</I></B>
</P>
<P>(1) If the make command breaks immediately with errors that indicate
it can't find files with a "*" in their names, this can be because
your machine's make doesn't support wildcard expansion in a makefile.
Try gmake instead of make.  If that doesn't work, try using a -f
switch with your make command to use Makefile.list which explicitly
lists all the needed files, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>make makelist
make -f Makefile.list linux
gmake -f Makefile.list mac 
</PRE>
<P>The first "make" command will create a current Makefile.list with all
the file names in your src dir.  The 2nd "make" command (make or
gmake) will use it to build ChemCell.
</P>
<P>(2) Other errors typically occur because the low-level Makefile isn't
setup correctly for your machine.  If your platform is named "foo",
you need to create a Makefile.foo in the MAKE directory.  Use whatever
existing file is closest to your platform as a starting point.  See
the next section for more instructions.
</P>
<P><B><I>Editing a new low-level Makefile.foo:</I></B>
</P>
<P>These are the issues you need to address when editing a low-level
Makefile for your machine.  With a couple exceptions, the only portion
of the file you should need to edit is the "System-specific Settings"
section.
</P>
<P>(1) Change the first line of Makefile.foo to include the word "foo"
and whatever other options you set.  This is the line you will see if
you just type "make".
</P>
<P>(2) Set the paths and flags for your C++ compiler, including
optimization flags.  You can use g++, the open-source GNU compiler,
which is available on all Unix systems.  Vendor compilers often
produce faster code.  On boxes with Intel CPUs, I use the free Intel
icc compiler, which you can download from <A HREF = "http://www.intel.com/software/products/noncom">Intel's compiler
site</A>.
</P>


<P>(3) If you want ChemCell to run in parallel, you must have two
libraries installed on your platform: MPI and Zoltan.  For MPI,
Makefile.foo needs to specify where the mpi.h file (-I switch) and the
libmpi.a library (-L switch) is found.  On my Linux box, I use
Argonne's MPICH 1.2 which can be downloaded from the <A HREF = "http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi">Argonne MPI
site</A>.  LAM MPI should also work.  If
you are running on a big parallel platform, your system people or the
vendor should have already installed a version of MPI, which will be
faster than MPICH or LAM, so find out how to link against it.  If you
use MPICH or LAM, you will have to configure and build it for your
platform.  The MPI configure script should have compiler options to
enable you to use the same compiler you are using for the ChemCell
build, which can avoid problems that may arise when linking ChemCell
to the MPI library.
</P>
<P>Zoltan is an open-source parallel load-balancing library, also
distributed by Sandia National Labs.  It can be downloaded at <A HREF = "zoltan">this
site</A>.  Follow its installation instructions.  It builds
out-of-the-box for many machines.  If not for yours, you will need to
edit a Config file suitable for your platform.  Once a Zoltan library
exists on your machine, add the appropriate -I, -L, and -l switches to
your Makefile.foo using one of the other MAKE/Makefile.* files as a
template.
</P>
<P>(4) If you just want ChemCell to run on a single processor, you can
use the STUBS library in place of MPI and Zoltan, since you don't need
either installed on your system.  See the Makefile.serial file for how
to specify the -I and -L switches.  You will also need to build the
STUBS library for your platform before making ChemCell itself.  From
the STUBS dir, type "make" and it will hopefully create the dummy
libraries suitable for linking to ChemCell.  If the build fails, you
will need to edit the STUBS/Makefile for your platform.
</P>
<P>The file STUBS/mpi.cpp has a CPU timer function MPI_Wtime() that calls
gettimeofday() .  If your system doesn't support gettimeofday() ,
you'll need to insert code to call another timer.  Note that the
ANSI-standard function clock() rolls over after an hour or so, and is
therefore insufficient for timing long ChemCell runs.
</P>
<P>(5) The DEPFLAGS setting is how the C++ compiler creates a dependency
file for each source file.  This speeds re-compilation when source
(*.cpp) or header (*.h) files are edited.  Some compilers do not
support dependency file creation, or may use a different switch than
-D.  GNU g++ works with -D.  If your compiler can't create dependency
files (a long list of errors involving *.d files), then you'll need to
create a Makefile.foo patterned after Makefile.tflop, which uses
different rules that do not involve dependency files.
</P>
<P>That's it.  Once you have a correct Makefile.foo and you have
pre-built the MPI and FFT libraries it will use, all you need to do
from the src directory is type one of these 2 commands:
</P>
<PRE>make foo
gmake foo 
</PRE>
<P>You should get the executable ccell_foo when the build is complete.
</P>
<P><B><I>Additional build tips:</I></B>
</P>
<P>(1) Building ChemCell for multiple platforms.
</P>
<P>You can make ChemCell for multiple platforms from the same src
directory.  Each target creates its own object sub-dir called Obj_name
where it stores the system-specific *.o files.
</P>
<P>(2) Cleaning up.
</P>
<P>Typing "make clean" will delete all *.o object files created when
ChemCell is built.
</P>
<P>(3) Building for a Macintosh.
</P>
<P>OS X is BSD Unix, so it already works.  See the Makefile.mac file.
</P>
<P>(4) Building for MicroSoft Windows.
</P>
<P>I've never done this, but ChemCell is just standard C++ with MPI and FFT
calls.  You should be able to use cygwin to build ChemCell with a
Unix-style make.  Or you should be able to pull all the source files
into Visual C++ (ugh) or some similar development environment and
build it.  In the src/MAKE directory are some Notes from users on how
they built ChemCell under Windows, so you can look at their instructions
for tips.  Good luck - I can't help you on this one.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "2_3"></A>2.3 Running ChemCell 
</H4>
<P>By default, ChemCell runs by reading commands from stdin;
e.g. ccell_linux < in.file.  This means you first create an input
script (e.g. in.file) containing the desired commands.  <A HREF = "Section_commands.html">This
section</A> describes how input scripts are
structured and what commands they contain.
</P>
<P>You can test ChemCell on any of the sample inputs provided in the
examples directory.  Input scripts are named in.* and sample outputs
are named log.*.
</P>
<P>Here is how you might run the simple A + B <-> C reaction network on a
Linux box.
</P>
<PRE>cd src
make linux
cp ccell_linux ../examples/abc
cd ../examples/abc
ccell_linux < in.abc 
</PRE>
<P>If you wanted to run in parallel, mpirun could be used to launch ChemCell,
replaing the last command with
</P>
<PRE>mpirun -np 4 ccell_linux < in.abc 
</PRE>
<P>The screen output from ChemCell is described in the next section.  As
it runs, ChemCell also writes a log.ccell file with the same
information.  Note that this sequence of commands copied the ChemCell
executable (ccell_linux) to the directory with the input files.  If
you don't do this, ChemCell may look for input files or create output
files in the directory where the executable is, rather than where you
run it from.
</P>
<P>If ChemCell encounters errors in the input script or while running a
simulation it will print an ERROR message and stop or a WARNING
message and continue.  See <A HREF = "Section_errors.html">this section</A> for a
discussion of the various kinds of errors ChemCell detects, a list of
all ERROR and WARNING messages, and what to do about them.
</P>
<P>For spatial simulations ChemCell can run a problem on any number of
processors, including a single processor.  You should get identical
answers on any number of processors and on any machine.  In practice,
numerical round-off on different machines can cause slight differences
and eventual divergence of two simulations.
</P>
<P>ChemCell can run as large a problem as will fit in the physical memory
of one or more processors.  If you run out of memory, you must run on
more processors or setup a smaller problem.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "2_4"></A>2.4 Command-line options 
</H4>
<P>At run time, ChemCell recognizes several optional command-line switches
which may be used in any order.  For example, ccell_ibm might be
launched as follows:
</P>
<PRE>mpirun -np 16 ccell_ibm -var f tmp.out -log my.log -screen none < in.ecoli 
</PRE>
<P>These are the command-line options:
</P>
<PRE>-partition 8x2 4 5 ... 
</PRE>
<P>Invoke ChemCell in multi-partition mode.  When ChemCell is run on P
processors and this switch is not used, ChemCell runs in one partition,
i.e. all P processors run a single simulation.  If this switch is
used, the P processors are split into separate partitions and each
partition runs its own simulation.  The arguments to the switch
specify the number of processors in each partition.  Arguments of the
form MxN mean M partitions, each with N processors.  Arguments of the
form N mean a single partition with N processors.  The sum of
processors in all partitions must equal P.  Thus the command
"-partition 8x2 4 5" has 10 partitions and runs on a total of 25
processors.
</P>
<P>The input script specifies what simulation is run on which partition;
see the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> and <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> commands.
</P>
<PRE>-in file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a file to use as an input script.  This is an optional switch
when running ChemCell in one-partition mode.  If it is not specified,
ChemCell reads its input script from stdin - e.g. ccell_linux <
in.run.  This is a required switch when running ChemCell in
multi-partition mode, since multiple processors cannot all read from
stdin.
</P>
<PRE>-log file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a log file for ChemCell to write status information to.  In
one-partition mode, if the switch is not used, ChemCell writes to the
file log.ccell.  If this switch is used, ChemCell writes to the
specified file.  In multi-partition mode, if the switch is not used, a
log.ccell file is created with hi-level status information.  Each
partition also writes to a log.ccell.N file where N is the partition
ID.  If the switch is specified in multi-partition mode, the hi-level
logfile is named "file" and each partition also logs information to a
file.N.  For both one-partition and multi-partition mode, if the
specified file is "none", then no log files are created.  Using a
<A HREF = "log.html">log</A> command in the input script will override this setting.
</P>
<PRE>-screen file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a file for ChemCell to write it's screen information to.  In
one-partition mode, if the switch is not used, ChemCell writes to the
screen.  If this switch is used, ChemCell writes to the specified file
instead and you will see no screen output.  In multi-partition mode,
if the switch is not used, hi-level status information is written to
the screen.  Each partition also writes to a screen.N file where N is
the partition ID.  If the switch is specified in multi-partition mode,
the hi-level screen dump is named "file" and each partition also
writes screen information to a file.N.  For both one-partition and
multi-partition mode, if the specified file is "none", then no screen
output is performed.
</P>
<PRE>-var X value 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a variable that will be defined for substitution purposes when
the input script is read.  X should be a single lower-case character
from 'a' to 'z'.  The value can be any string.  Using this
command-line option is equivalent to putting the line "variable X
index value" at the beginning of the input script.  See the
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for more information.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "2_5"></A>2.5 ChemCell screen output 
</H4>
<P>As ChemCell reads an input script, it prints information to both the
screen and a log file about significant actions it takes to setup a
simulation.  When the simulation is ready to begin, ChemCell performs
various initializations and prints information about species,
diffusion, reactions, and binning (used to find nearby particles).  It
also prints details of the initial species counts for the system.
During the run itself, species counts are printed periodically, every
few timesteps.  When the run concludes, ChemCell prints the final
species countsa and a total run time for the simulation.  It then
appends additional statistics about the run.  An example set of
statistics is shown here:
</P>
<P>Loop time of 14.0014 on 1 procs for 100 steps
</P>
<P>Move  time (%) = 0.9302 (6.6436)

<P>The first section gives the breakdown of the CPU run time (in seconds)
into major categories.  The second section lists the number of owned
particles (Nlocal), ghost particles (Nghost), and bins stored by
processor.  The max and min values give the spread of these values
across processors with a 10-bin histogram showing the distribution.
The total number of histogram counts is equal to the number of
processors.
</P>
<P>The last section gives aggregate statistics for diffusion and
reactions during the run.  The memory usage per processor is
summarized.  And a mapping of species names to index numbers is given
which is useful for analyzing dump files of particle coordinates.
