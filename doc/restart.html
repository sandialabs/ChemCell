<H3>restart command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>restart 0
restart N root
restart N file1 file2 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>N = write a restart file every this many timesteps
<LI>root = filename to which timestep # is appended
<LI>file1,file2 = two full filenames, toggle between them when writing file 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>restart 0
restart 1000 ecoli.restart
restart 10000 ecoli.r.1 ecoli.r.2 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Write out a binary restart file every so many timesteps as a run
proceeds.  A value of 0 means do not write out restart files.  Using
one filename as an argument will create a series of filenames with a
timestep suffix, e.g. the 2nd example above will create
ecoli.restart.1000, ecoli.restart.2000, ecoli.restart.3000, etc.
Using two filenames will produce only 2 restart files.  ChemCell will
toggle between the 2 names as it writes successive restart files.
</P>
<P>Only particle information is stored in a restart file.
</P>
<P>Restart files can be read by a <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
command to restart a simulation from a particular state.  Because the
file is binary (to enable exact restarts), it may not be readable on
another machine.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used for spatial simulations.
