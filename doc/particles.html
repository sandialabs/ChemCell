<H3>particles command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>particles species-ID N surface-ID 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>species-ID = user-assigned species name for particles
<LI>N = number of particles that follow
<LI>surface-ID = optional surface ID to place the particles on 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>particles Ca 10000
particles receptor 500 membrane 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Read N particles of type species-ID from successive lines of the input
script.  The species-ID must already have been defined via the
<A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command.  If the species is 3D, do not use the
surface-ID argument.  If the species is 2d, the surface-ID argument
must be used to specify what region or triangulated surface the
particles are on.  Note that the species dimensionality must have
already been set (default or via the <A HREF = "dimension.html">dimension</A>
command) before particles are read in.
</P>
<P>Following the particles command, the next line in the input script is
skipped (leave it blank).  The following N lines should have an index
(1-N) and 3 particle coordinates (x,y,z in microns) on each line.
</P>
<P>Note that a long list of particles can be put in a separate file and
read in via the <A HREF = "include.html">include</A> command.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "bin.html">bin command</A> must be used before defining particles.
</P>
<P>This command can only be used for spatial simulations.
