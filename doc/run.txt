run command :h3

[Syntax:]

run N
run delta :pre

N = run for N timesteps (integer value)
delta = run for delta seconds (floating point value) :ul

[Examples:]

run 1000
run 5.0 :pre

[Description:]

Run a simulation for N timesteps or delta seconds.  If a previous run
was made, this command continues the simulation.

The length of the run can be specied in timesteps or elapsed
simulation time.  Using an integer versus a floating-point value (with
a decimal point) determines how the argument is interpreted.

For stochastic non-spatial (Gillepsie) simulations, N refers to a
number of reactions, since there is one timestep/reaction.

[Restrictions:] none
