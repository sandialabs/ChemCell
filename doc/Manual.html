<P>ChemCell is a particle-based reaction/diffusion simulator designed for
modeling protein networks in biological cells with spatial
information.  Compartments within the cell are bounded by membrane
surfaces defined as geometric regions or connected triangles.
Particles represent individual biomolecules and diffuse via Brownian
motion in 3d and on 2d surfaces.  Particles react with neighboring
particles according to rules derived from chemical rate equations.
Non-spatial models can also be run using an ODE solver or the
Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA).  Spatial simulations
can be run in parallel as can multiple instances of non-spatial
simluations for statistical averaging.  The <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py package</A>
of Python-based tools can create input files for ChemCell and
visualize and plot its output.
</P>
<P>ChemCell was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US
Department of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE.  It is an
open-source code, designed to be easy to modify and extend with new
functionality.  It is distributed freely under the terms of the GNU
Public License (GPL).
</P>
<P>The authors of the code are <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">Steve Plimpton</A> and Alex Slepoy, who
can be contacted at sjplimp at sandia.gov and alexander.sleopy at
nnsa.doe.gov.  The <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/chemcell.html">ChemCell WWW Site</A> at
www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/chemcell.html has more information about
the code and its uses.
