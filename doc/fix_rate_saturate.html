</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the concentration level of certain species at specified time
increments in a non-spatial simulation.  This is an effective way of
coupling ChemCell to another model or simulation that produced
concentration vs time profiles of certain species.
</P>
<P>Here is how the fix operates.  Every N timesteps, the concentration or
count of particles of each species in the specified list is reset to a
new value which is listed in the time course data file, which has the
following format.  Lines beginning with a "#" character are ignored.
Other lines must begin with a time value (in seconds), followed by Nsp
values.  The time stamp for successive lines in the file should be
monotonically increasing.  For stochastic non-spatial simulations
(Gillespie), the value for each species is a particle count.  For
deterministic non-spatial simulations (ODE), the value for each
species is a concentration in molarity.
</P>
<P>On a timestep when the fix is applied, the file line with a time stamp
just smaller (or equal) to the current time is used to set the Nout
probabilities.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix can only be used with non-spatial simulations.
