<H3>fix rate/saturate command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID rate/saturate N species-ID half volscale react1-ID react2-ID ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command
<LI>rate/saturate = style name of this fix command
<LI>N = apply fix every this many timesteps
<LI>species-ID = ID of species whose dynamic concentration will affect rate
<LI>half = concentration of species-ID which will cut rate in half (molarity)
<LI>volscale = scale factor to apply to concentration of species-ID
<LI>react1-ID, react2-ID, ... = list of reactions whose rates are affected

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Adjust one or more reaction rates based on the current concentration
of a chosen species.  This is a way to have a time-dependent rate for
a reaction that goes to zero as the concentration of one of its
reactants increases, so that the amount of product produced
effectively saturates rather than increases forever.  For example, it
can be used to model gene transcription resulting in mRNA production.
</P>
<P>Here is how the fix operates.  Every N timesteps, the rates for the
listed reactions are scaled to new values in the following way:
</P>
<PRE>r_new = r_initial * half / (half + [species-ID]) 
</PRE>
<P>R_new(t) is the new scaled reaction rate.  R_initial is the rate set
for this reaction initially in the input script.  Half is the
concentration value set by this command.  [Species-ID] is the
current concentration of the selected species.
</P>
<P>For continuum ODE simulations this concentration is stored directly by
ChemCell and is correct for whatever compartment the species may be
in.  Thus the <I>volscale</I> parameter is ignored.  For stochastic models,
the concentration is computed by the molecule count divided by the
volume.  It is then scaled by the specified <I>volscale</I> parameter.
This should be set to 1.0 if the system volume is the one in which
<I>species-ID</I> is present.  If the concentration is for a species in a
smaller volume (e.g. the nucleus), then <I>volscale</I> should be set to
the ratio of the system volume to the smaller volume, e.g. 10.0 if the
cell is 10x larger than the nucleus.
</P>
<P>Note that the <I>half</I> parameter is the concentration of species-ID at
which the effective rate will be cut in half.  Note that the scale
factor half / (half + [species-ID]) is unitless.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix can only be used with non-spatial simulations.
