<H3>fix rate/saturate command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID rate/saturate N species-ID half react1-ID react2-ID ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command
<LI>conc/random = style name of this fix command
<LI>N = apply fix every this many timesteps
<LI>species-ID = ID of species whose dynamic concentration will affect rate
<LI>half = concentration of species-ID which will cut rate in half (molarity)
<LI>react1-ID, react2-ID, ... = list of reactions whose rates are affected

<PRE>fix mine rate/saturate 1 NFkB-nuc 100 c1 u1 u3 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Adjust one or more reaction rates based on the current concentration
of a chosen species.  This is a way to have a time-dependent rate for
a reaction that goes to zero as the concentration of one of its
reactants increases, so that the amout of product produced saturates
rather than increases forever.  For example, it can be used to
model gene transcription resulting in mRNA production.
</P>
<P>Here is how the fix operates.  Every N timesteps, the rates for the
listed reactions are scaled to new values in the following way:
</P>
<PRE>r_new = r_initial * half / (half + [species-ID]) 
</PRE>
<P>R(t) is the new scaled reaction rate.  R_initial is the rate set for
this reaction initially in the input script.  Half is the
concentration value set for this command.  [Species-ID] is the
current concentration of the selected species.  Note that half is the
concentration value of species-ID at which the effective rate will be
cut in half.  Note that the scale factor half / (half +
[species-ID]) is unitless.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>

<P>This fix can only be used with non-spatial simulations.
