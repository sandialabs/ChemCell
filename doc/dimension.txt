dimension command :h3

[Syntax:]

dimension species-ID value

species-ID = particle species
value = dimensionality of species = 2 or 3 :ul

[Examples:]

dimension Ca 3
dimension receptor* 2 :pre

[Description:]

Set the dimensionality for one or more particle species.  A value of 3
means the particles diffuse volumetrically.  A value of 2 means the
particles diffuse on a surface; see the "region"_region.html or
"triangles"_triangles.html command.

The species-ID can contain a single wildcard character * which will
match species and alias names in the usual way.  E.g. species-ID can
be *, ab*, *ab, ab*cd.

[Restrictions:]

The dimensionality of a species cannot be changed if particles of that
species already exist

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

Dimension = 3 for all species.
