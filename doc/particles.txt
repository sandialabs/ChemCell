particles command :h3

[Syntax:]

particles species-ID N surface-ID :pre

species-ID = user-assigned species name for particles
N = number of particles that follow
surface-ID = optional surface ID to place the particles on :ul

[Examples:]

particles Ca 10000
particles receptor 500 membrane :pre

[Description:]

Read N particles of type species-ID from successive lines of the input
script.  The species-ID must already have been defined via the
"species"_species.html command.  If the species is 3D, do not use the
surface-ID argument.  If the species is 2d, the surface-ID argument
must be used to specify what region or triangulated surface the
particles are on.  Note that the species dimensionality must have
already been set (default or via the "dimension"_dimension.html
command) before particles are read in.

Following the particles command, the next line in the input script is
skipped (leave it blank).  The following N lines should have an index
(1-N) and 3 particle coordinates (x,y,z in microns) on each line.

Note that a long list of particles can be put in a separate file and
read in via the "include"_include.html command.

[Restrictions:]

The "bin command"_bin.html must be used before defining particles.

This command can only be used for spatial simulations.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
