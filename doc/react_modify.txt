react_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

react_modify reaction-ID keyword value(s) ... :pre

reaction-ID = ID of reaction to modify :ulb,l
one or more keyword/value pairs can be specified :l
  keywords = {rate} or {loc} or {dist} or {prob} or {weight}
  {rate} value = rate
    rate = reaction rate (same units as in "reaction"_reaction.html command)
  {loc} values = product styleflag whichflag dirflag
    product = which product (1-N)
    styleflag = {def} or {at} or {near}
    whichflag = {def} or {1} or {2} or {1/2}
    dirflag = {def} or {in} or {out} or {in/out}
  {dist} = R
    R = distance at which reactants will react (microns)
  {prob} = P
    P = probability (0-1) with which reactants react
  {weight} values = which index ratio
    which = {reactant} or {product}
    index = which reactant or product (1-N)
    ratio = weighting factor to apply :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

react_modify 1 dist 0.05 prob 1.0
react_modify channel 2 near 2 out :pre 

[Description:]

Reset one or more parameters of a specific reaction.

The {rate} keyword resets the reaction rate.

The {loc} keyword sets the location at which a product of the reaction
is placed.  The {product} setting determines which product (1 to N).
A value of -1 means all products.  The {styleflag} setting refers to
placing the product at or near a reactant's location.  The {whichflag}
setting refers to which reactant (1 to N) to place the product at or
near.  A value of {1/2} means to randomly choose which reactant each
time a reaction occurs.  The {dirflag} setting only applies to 3d
products placed near 2d reactants and refers to which side of the
surface (inside or outside) to place the product on.  A value of
{in/out} means to randomly choose the side each time a reaction
occurs.  A value of {def} for default should be used if {dirflag} does
not apply.

Depending on the kind of reaction (1 or 2 reactants) and whether the
reactants are 3d diffusing species or 2d (on a surface), certain
combinations of settings are invalid and will generate errors.  Note
that only 3d products can be placed at a 3d reactant's location.  Only
2d products can be placed at a 2d reactant's location.  And only 3d
products can be placed near a 2d reactant's location, which means to
place it a distance epsilon from the surface the 2d reactant is on.

These are the default rules for reactions with a single reactant:

If the reactant and product are 3d, \
  put the product at the location of the reactant.
If the reactant and product are 2d, \
  put the product at the location of the reactant.
If the reactant is 3d and the product is 2d, this is an error.
If the reactant is 2d and the product is 3d, \
  put the product near the reactant on the inside of the surface. :ul

These are the default rules for reactions with two reactants:

If both reactants and the product are 2d, put the product at the \
  location of the reactant with the smaller diffusion coeff.
If both reactants and the product are 3d, put the product at the \
  location of the reactant with the smaller diffusion coeff.
If one reactant is 2d and the other 3d and the product is 3d, put the \
  product at the 3d reactant's location.
If one reactant is 2d and the other 3d and the product is 2d, put the \
  product at the 2d reactant's location.
If both reactants are 3d and the product is 2d, this is an error.
If both reactants are 2d and the product is 3d, put the product \
  a distance epsilon away from the reactant with the smaller diffusion coeff \
  on the inside of the surface.
In all cases where diffusion coeffs are used, if the diffusion coeffs of \
  the 2 reactants are equal, the 1st reactant is used. :ul

The {dist} keyword explicitly sets the cutoff distance for a binary
reaction bewteen two reactants.  Normally, ChemCell sets this distance
itself (see the "probability"_probability.html command for options).
Setting the {dist} value to -1.0 turns off the explicit setting;
ChemCell will again compute the reaction cutoff.

The {prob} keyword explicitly sets the probablility (from 0.0 to 1.0)
for a binary reaction to take place (assuming the reactants are within
the cutoff distance).  Normally, ChemCell sets this probability itself
(see the "probability"_probability.html command for options).  Setting
the {prob} value to -1.0 turns off the explicit setting; ChemCell will
again compute the probability.

Note that the {dist} and {prob} keywords give you the option of
setting reaction parameters directly, using your own formulation or
algorithms and settings from another code.  For example, the
"Smoldyn"_smoldyn simulator calculates a variety of reaction
parameterizations for different kinds of reactions, as described in
"(Andrews)"_#Andrews.  Essentially it computes reaction cutoff
distances (binding radii in Smoldyn nomenclature) as a function of
diffusion coefficients of the reactants, timestep, and reaction rate.
The Smoldyn formulation spans the spectrum from diffusion-limited to
reaction-limited reactions and thus produces reaction cutoff distances
which are more accurate and complete than the simple heuristic that
ChemCell uses by default.

The {weight} keyword sets a volume weighting factor for a specific
reactant or product which adjusts its concentration the reaction
occurs and the species is removed or produced.  This can be used by
non-spatial, continuum simulations (ODEs) to weight the effects of a
reaction.  The weighting factor can be thought of as a volume ratio
between 2 compartments, so a factor can be set to enable a
multi-compartment ODE solution where each compartment has its own
volume.

[Restrictions:] none

The {loc} and {dist} and {prob} keywords only apply to spatial
simulations.  The {weight} keyword only applies to non-spatial,
continuum (ODE) simulations.
