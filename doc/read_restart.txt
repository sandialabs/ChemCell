read_restart command :h3

[Syntax:]

read_restart file :pre

file = name of binary restart file to read in :ul

[Examples:]

read_restart save.10000 :pre

[Description:]

Read in a previously saved set of particles from a restart file.  This
allows continuation of a previous spatial simulation.

Only particle information is stored in the restart file.  Thus before
reading a restart file, you should re-define species and geometry
information, and must setup bins via the "bin"_bin.html command.

Because restart files are binary, they may not be portable to other
machines.

[Restrictions:] none

The "bin"_bin.html command must be used before reading a restart file.

This command can only be used for spatial simulations.

[Related commands:]

"write_restart"_write_restart.html, "restart"_restart.html

[Default:] none
