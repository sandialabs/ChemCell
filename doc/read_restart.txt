read_restart command :h3

[Syntax:]

read_restart file :pre

file = name of binary restart file to read in :ul

[Examples:]

read_restart save.10000 :pre

[Description:]

Read in a previously saved problem from a restart file.  This allows
continuation of a previous run.

Only particle information is stored in the restart file.  Thus before
reading a restart file, you should re-define species and geometry
information, and must setup bins (via the "bin"_bin.html command).

Because restart files are binary, they may not be portable to other
machines.

[Restrictions:] none

The "bin command"_bin.html must be used before reading a restart file.

[Related commands:]

"write_restart"_write_restart.html, "restart"_restart.html

[Default:] none
