<H3>5. Additional tools 
</H3>
<P>ChemCell is designed to be a computational kernel for performing
reaction/diffusion computations.  Additional pre- and post-processing
steps are typically needed to setup and analyze a simulation.
</P>
<P>Our group has written and released a separate toolkit called
<A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py</A> which provides tools for doing setup, analysis,
plotting, and visualization for ChemCell simulations.  Pizza.py is
written in <A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A> and is available for download from <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">the
Pizza.py WWW site</A>.  Images and movies created by Pizza.py are
displayed on the <A HREF = "http://chemcell.sandia.gov">ChemCell WWW site</A>.
</P>




<P>Pizza.py has a "cdata" tool with many sub-commands for reading and
creating regions, surfaces, particles.  The resulting geoemtries can
be visualized with other Pizza.py tools: "gl", "vcr", "raster", "svg",
etc.
</P>
<P>Similarly, Pizza.py has a "dump" tool which reads in ChemCell dump
files and allows particles to be selected, visualized, and animated,
along with the ChemCell geoemtry (regions, triangulated surfaces) via
the same Pizza.py tools.
</P>
<P>Pizza.py also has a "clog" tool which reads in ChemCell log files and
allows the species concentration statistics to be plotted either via
GnuPlot ("gnu" tool) or MatLab ("matlab" tool).
</P>
<P>If you write additional tools (either stand-alone or as part of
Pizza.py) that you think are generally useful for setting up or
analyzing ChemCell simulations, send us an email; we can include them
as part of the ChemCell or Pizza.py packages.
