move_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

move_style option1 option2 ... :pre

options = {cube} or {sphere} or {square} or {circle} or {uniform} or {brownian} :ul

[Examples:]

move_style sphere brownian
move_style circle uniform :pre

[Description:]

Set one or more options that determine how particles move in a spatial
simulation.

The {cube} option means particle will sample points in a small cube
around their locations.  The {sphere} option means particles will
sample points in a small sphere around their location.

The {square} option means particles will only move in 2d and sample
points in a small xy square around their locations.  The {cirlce}
option means particles will only move in 2d and samples points in a
small xy circle around their locations.  These options can be used
with a "global"_global.html simulation domain that is small in the
z-dimension to effectively setup a 2d simulation.

The {uniform} option means the sampling of volumetric (or planar)
space is uniform.  The {brownian} option means the sampling is from a
Gaussian so that particles move in Brownian motion.

For 2d particles diffusing on regions or triangulated surfaces, only
the uniform/brownian options are relevant since particles always
effectively move in 2d, sampling within a circle tangential to the
surface.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used for spatial simulations.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

The default move style is cube brownian.
