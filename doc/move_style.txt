move_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

move_style option1 option2 ... :pre

options = {cube} or {sphere} or {square} or {circle} or {uniform} or
{brownian} :ul

[Examples:]

move_style sphere brownian
move_style circle uniform :pre

[Description:]

Set one or more options that determine how particles move in a spatial
simulation.

The {cube} option means the particle samples points in a small cube
around its location.  The {sphere} option means the particle samples
points in a small sphere around its location.

The {square} option means the particle only moves in 2d and samples
points in a small xy square around its location.  The {cirlce} option
means the particle only moves in 2d and samples points in a small xy
circle around its location.  These options can be used with a
"global"_global.html simulation domain that is small in the
z-dimension to setup an effectively 2d simulation.

The {uniform} option means the sampling of volumetric (or planar)
space is uniform.  The {brownian} option means the sampling is a
Gaussian corresponding to Brownian motion

For 2d particles diffusing on regions or triangulated surfaces, only
the uniform/brownian options are relevant since the particle always
samples within a circle tangential to the surface.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

The default move_style is cube brownian.
