<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Randomize the species type of certain particles at specified time
increments in a spatial simulation.  This is an effective way of
coupling ChemCell to another model or simulation that pre-computed
concentration vs time profiles of certain species.
</P>
<P>Here is how the fix operates.  Every N timesteps, the list of current
particles is scanned.  Each partice with a species type in the list of
Nin input species has its species type reset to a new value which is
one of the Nout output species.  Each of the Nout species has a
fractional probability associated with it (between 0.0 and 1.0), which
sum to 1.0.  The assignment of a particle to a new species is done
randomly, in accord with those probabilities.
</P>
<P>The probabilities for new species can be time-dependent and are
read-in from the time-course data file, which has the following
format.  Lines beginning with a "#" character are ignored.  Other
lines must begin with a time value (in seconds), followed by Nout-1
values (between 0.0 and 1.0) which sum to a value <= 1.0.  These are
the probabilities for each of the Nout species.  The value for the
last Nout species is set to 1.0 - sum.  The time stamp for successive
lines in the file should be monotonically increasing.
</P>
<P>On a timestep when the fix is applied, the file line with a time stamp
just smaller (or equal) to the current time is used to set the Nout
probabilities.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix can only be used with spatial simulations.
