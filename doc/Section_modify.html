<H3>6. Modifying & extending ChemCell 
</H3>
<P>ChemCell is designed in a modular fashion so as to be easy to modify
and extend with new functionality.  In this section, changes and
additions users can make are listed along with some minimal
instructions.  Realistically, the best way to add a new feature is to
find a similar feature in ChemCell and look at the corresponding
source and header files to figure out what it does.  You will need
some knowledge of C++ to be able to understand the hi-level structure
of ChemCell and its class organization, but functions (class methods)
that do actual computations are written in vanilla C-style code and
typically operate on simple C-style data structures (vectors and
arrays).
</P>
<P>Most of the new features described in this section require you to
write a new C++ class.  Creating a new class requires 2 files, a
source code file (*.cpp) and a header file (*.h).  Their contents are
briefly discussed below.  Enabling ChemCell to invoke the new class is
as simple as adding two definition lines to the style.h file, in the
same syntax as the existing ChemCell classes are defined in the
style.h file.
</P>
<P>The power of C++ and its object-orientation is that usually, all the
code and variables needed to define the new feature are contained in
the 2 files you write, and thus shouldn't make the rest of the code
more complex or cause side-effect bugs.
</P>
<P>Here is a concrete example.  Suppose you write 2 files fix_foo.cpp and
fix_foo.h that define a new class FixFoo that implements a boundary
condition described in the classic 1997 <A HREF = "#Foo">paper</A> by Foo, et. al.
If you wish to invoke that boundary condition in a ChemCell input
script with a command like
</P>
<PRE>fix 1 foo 0.1 3.5 
</PRE>
<P>you simply need to put your 2 files in the ChemCell src directory, add
2 lines to the style.h file, and re-make the code.
</P>
<P>The first line added to style.h would be
</P>
<PRE>FixStyle(foo,FixFoo) 
</PRE>
<P>in the #ifdef FixClass section, where "foo" is the style keyword in
the pair_style command, and FixFoo is the class name in your C++
files.
</P>
<P>The 2nd line added to style.h would be
</P>
<PRE>#include "fix_foo.h" 
</PRE>
<P>in the #ifdef FixInclude section, where fix_foo.h is the name of your
new include file.
</P>
<P>When you re-make ChemCell, your new boundary condition becomes part of
the executable and can be invoked with a fix command like the example
above.  Arguments like 0.1 and 3.5 can be defined and processed by
your new class.
</P>
<P>Note that if you are using Makefile.list instead of Makefile to build
ChemCell, you will need to explicitly add the names of your new .cpp and
.h file to Makefile.list.
</P>
<P>Here is a list of the kinds of new features that can be added in this
way:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "#region">Region geometry options</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#fix">Fix options</A> which include boundary conditions,    diagnostic output, etc
<LI><A HREF = "#simulator">Simulator options</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#command">New top-level commands</A> 
</UL>
<P>As illustrated by the fix example, these options are referred to in
the ChemCell documentation as the "style" of a particular command.
</P>
<P>The instructions below for each category will list the header file for
the parent class that these styles are sub-classes of.  Public
variables in that file are ones used and set by the sub-classes which
are also used by the parent class.  Sometimes they are also used by
the rest of ChemCell.  Virtual functions in the header file which are
set = 0 are ones you must define in your new class to give it the
functionality ChemCell expects.  Virtual functions that are not set to 0
are functions you can optionally define.
</P>
<P>Here are some additional guidelines for modifying ChemCell and adding
new functionality:
</P>
<P>Think about whether what you want to do would be better as a pre- or
post-processing step.  Many computations are more easily and more
quickly done that way.
</P>
<P>If you add something useful, send me an <A HREF = "mailto:sjplimp@sandia.gov">email</A>.  We might be
interested in adding it to the ChemCell distribution.
</P>

<A NAME = "region"></A><H4>Region geometry options 
</H4>
<P>Classes that define simple geometric regions are sub-classes of the
Region class.  See the region.h file for a list of methods these
classes defines.  Regions are used in ChemCell to define surfaces
which particles diffuse between or on.
</P>
<P>Region_sphere.cpp and region_sphere.h are the simplest example of a
Region class.  They implement the <I>sphere</I> style of the
<A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command.
</P>
<P>Here is a brief description of the class methods required:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  WIDTH="0%"  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >bbox</TD><TD > bounding box</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >inside</TD><TD > determine whether a point is in the region</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >hex_intersect</TD><TD > check if region surface intersects a hex cell</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >line_intersect</TD><TD > check if line segment intersects region surface</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >compute_normal</TD><TD > unit normal to region at a point</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >move2d</TD><TD > perform a 2d move on region surface</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >distance</TD><TD > compute distance from point to region surface 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<HR>

<A NAME = "fix"></A><H4>Fix options 
</H4>
<P>In ChemCell, a "fix" is any operation that is computed during
timestepping that alters some property of the system.  Essentially
everything that happens during a simulation besides force computation,
neighbor list manipulation, and output, is a "fix".  This includes
time integration (update of velocity and coordinates), force
constraints (SHAKE or walls), and diagnostics (compute a diffusion
coefficient).  See the fix.h file for a list of methods these classes
defines.
</P>
<P>There are dozens of fix options in ChemCell; choose one as a template
that is similar to what you want to implement.  They can be as simple
as zeroing out forces (see <A HREF = "fix_enforce2d.html">fix enforce2d</A> which
corresponds to the <I>enforce2d</I> style) or as complicated as applying
SHAKE constraints on bonds and angles (see <A HREF = "fix_shake.html">fix shake</A>
which corresponds to the <I>shake</I> style) which involves many extra
computations.
</P>
<P>Here is a brief description of the class methods in fix.h:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  WIDTH="0%"  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >setmask</TD><TD > determines when the fix is called during the timestep</TD></TR>

<TR><TD >initial_integrate_respa</TD><TD > same as initial_integrate, but for rRESPA</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >post_force_respa</TD><TD > same as post_force, but for rRESPA</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >final_integrate_respa</TD><TD > same as final_integrate, but for rRESPA</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >pack_comm</TD><TD > pack a buffer to communicate a per-atom quantity</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >unpack_comm</TD><TD > unpack a buffer to communicate a per-atom quantity</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >pack_reverse_comm</TD><TD > pack a buffer to reverse communicate a per-atom quantity</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >unpack_reverse_comm</TD><TD > unpack a buffer to reverse communicate a per-atom quantity</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >thermo_fields</TD><TD > define quantities for thermodynamic output</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >thermo_compute</TD><TD > compute thermodynamic quantities 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>Typically, only a small fraction of these methods are defined for a
particular fix.  Setmask is mandatory, as it determines when the fix
will be invoked during the timestep.  Fixes that perform time
integration (<I>nve</I>, <I>nvt</I>, <I>npt</I>) implement initial_integrate and
final_integrate to perform velocity Verlet updates.  Fixes that
constrain forces implement post_force.  Fixes that perform diagnostics
typically implement end_of_step.
</P>
<P>If the fix needs to store information for each atom that persists from
timestep to timestep, it can manage that memory and migrate it with
the atoms as they move from processors to processor by implementing
the grow_arrays, copy_arrays, pack_exchange, and unpack_exchange
methods.  Similary, the pack_restart and unpack_restart methods can be
implemented to store information about the fix in restart files.  If
you wish a integrator or force constraint fix to work with rRESPA (see
the <A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style</A> command), the initial_integrate,
post_force_integrate, and final_integrate_respa methods can be
implemented.  The thermo_fields and thermo_compute methods enable a
fix to contribute values to thermodynamic output, as printed
quantities and/or to be summed to the potential energy of the system.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "atom"></A><H4>Atom options 
</H4>
<P>All classes that define an atom style are sub-classes of the Atom
class.  See the atom.h file for a list of methods these classes
defines.  The atom style determines what quantities are associated
with an atom in a ChemCell simulation.  If one of the existing atom
styles does not define all the arrays you need to store with an atom,
then a new atom class can be created.
</P>
<P>Atom_atomic.cpp and atom_atomic.h are the simplest example of an Atom
class.  They implement the <I>atomic</I> style of the
<A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style</A> command.
</P>
<P>Here is a brief description of the class methods in atom.h:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  WIDTH="0%"  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >copy</TD><TD > copy info for one atom to another atom's array location</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >pack_comm</TD><TD > store an atom's info in a buffer communicated every timestep</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >unpack_comm</TD><TD > retrieve an atom's info from the buffer</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >pack_reverse</TD><TD > store an atom's info in a buffer communicating partial forces</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >unpack_reverse</TD><TD > retrieve an atom's info from the buffer</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >pack_border</TD><TD > store an atom's info in a buffer communicated on neighbor re-builds</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >unpack_border</TD><TD > retrieve an atom's info from the buffer</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >pack_exchange</TD><TD > store all an atom's info to migrate to another processor</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >unpack_exchange</TD><TD > retrieve an atom's info from the buffer</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>There are also several methods in atom.cpp you will need to augment
with information about your new atom class, following the patterns of
the other atom styles.  These routines are so similar for all classes,
that it was simpler to just have one master routine for all classes.

<A NAME = "command"></A><H4>New Top-level Commands 
</H4>
<P>It is possible to add a new command to a ChemCell input script as
opposed to adding a new style to an existing command (atom_style,
pair_style, fix, etc).  For example the create_atoms, read_data,
velocity, and run commands are all top-level ChemCell commands that are
listed in the Command section of style.h.  When such a command is
encountered in the ChemCell input script, the topmost level of ChemCell
(ChemCell.cpp) simply creates a class with the corresponding name,
invokes the "command" method of the class, and passes it the arguments
from the input script.  The command method can perform whatever
operations it wishes on the ChemCell data structures.
</P>
<P>Thus to add a new command, you simply need to add a *.cpp and *.h file
containing a single class:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  WIDTH="0%"  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >command</TD><TD > operations performed by the new command 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>Of course, the new class can define other methods and variables that
it uses internally.
