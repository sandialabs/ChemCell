<H3>6. Modifying & extending ChemCell 
</H3>
<P>ChemCell is designed in a modular fashion so as to be easy to modify
and extend with new functionality.  In this section, changes and
additions users can make are listed along with some minimal
instructions.  Realistically, the best way to add a new feature is to
find a similar feature in ChemCell and look at the corresponding
source and header files to figure out what it does.  You will need
some knowledge of C++ to be able to understand the hi-level structure
of ChemCell and its class organization, but functions (class methods)
that do actual computations are written in vanilla C-style code and
typically operate on simple C-style data structures (vectors and
arrays).
</P>
<P>The new features described in this section require you to write a new
C++ class.  Creating a new class requires 2 files, a source code file
(*.cpp) and a header file (*.h).  Their contents are briefly discussed
below.  Enabling ChemCell to invoke the new class is as simple as
adding two definition lines to the style.h file, in the same syntax as
the existing ChemCell classes are defined in the style.h file.
</P>
<P>The power of C++ and its object-orientation is that usually, all the
code and variables needed to define the new feature are contained in
the 2 files you write, and thus shouldn't make the rest of the code
more complex or cause side-effect bugs.
</P>
<P>Here is a concrete example.  Suppose you write 2 files fix_foo.cpp and
fix_foo.h that define a new class FixFoo that implements a boundary
condition described in the classic 1997 <A HREF = "#Foo">paper</A> by Foo, et. al.
If you wish to invoke that boundary condition in a ChemCell input
script with a command like
</P>
<PRE>fix 1 foo 0.1 3.5 
</PRE>
<P>you simply need to put your 2 files in the ChemCell src directory, add
2 lines to the style.h file, and re-make the code.
</P>
<P>The first line added to style.h would be
</P>
<PRE>FixStyle(foo,FixFoo) 
</PRE>
<P>in the #ifdef FixClass section, where "foo" is the style keyword in
the pair_style command, and FixFoo is the class name in your C++
files.
</P>
<P>The 2nd line added to style.h would be
</P>
<PRE>#include "fix_foo.h" 
</PRE>
<P>in the #ifdef FixInclude section, where fix_foo.h is the name of your
new include file.
</P>
<P>When you re-make ChemCell, your new boundary condition becomes part of
the executable and can be invoked with a fix command like the example
above.  Arguments like 0.1 and 3.5 can be defined and processed by
your new class.
</P>
<P>Note that if you are using Makefile.list instead of Makefile to build
ChemCell, you will need to explicitly add the names of your new .cpp and
.h file to Makefile.list.
</P>
<P>Here is a list of the kinds of new features that can be added in this
way:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "#region">Region geometry options</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#fix">Fix options</A> which include boundary conditions,    diagnostic output, etc
<LI><A HREF = "#simulator">Simulator options</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#command">New top-level commands</A> 
</UL>
<P>As illustrated by the fix example, these options are referred to in
the ChemCell documentation as the "style" of a particular command.
</P>
<P>The instructions below for each category will list the header file for
the parent class that these styles are sub-classes of.  Public
variables in that file are ones used and set by the sub-classes which
are also used by the parent class.  Sometimes they are also used by
the rest of ChemCell.  Virtual functions in the header file which are
set = 0 are ones you must define in your new class to give it the
functionality ChemCell expects.  Virtual functions that are not set to 0
are functions you can optionally define.
</P>

<A NAME = "region"></A><H4>Region geometry options 
</H4>
<P>Classes that define simple geometric regions are sub-classes of the
Region class.  See the region.h file for a list of methods these
classes defines.  Regions are used in ChemCell to define surfaces
which particles diffuse between or on.
</P>
<P>Region_sphere.cpp and region_sphere.h are the simplest example of a
Region class.  They implement the <I>sphere</I> style of the
<A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command.
</P>
<P>Here is a brief description of the class methods required:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >bbox</TD><TD > bounding box</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >inside</TD><TD > determine whether a point is in the region</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >hex_intersect</TD><TD > check if region surface intersects a hex cell</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >line_intersect</TD><TD > check if line segment intersects region surface</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >compute_normal</TD><TD > unit normal to region at a point</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >move2d</TD><TD > perform a 2d move on region surface</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >distance</TD><TD > compute distance from point to region surface 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<HR>

<A NAME = "fix"></A><H4>Fix options 
</H4>
<P>In ChemCell, a "fix" is any operation that is computed during
timestepping that alters some property of the system.  It could be
alteration of a rate or a rate equation, implementation of a boundary
condition, or calculation of some diagnostic property.  See the fix.h
file for a list of methods these classes define.
</P>
<P>Here is a brief description of the class methods.  All of these
methods are optional.
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >init</TD><TD > called before timestepping</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >initial</TD><TD > called at the beginning of each timestep</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >final</TD><TD > called at the end of each timestep</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >cleanup</TD><TD > called after timestepping 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<HR>

<A NAME = "simulator"></A><H4>Simulator options 
</H4>
<P>Classes that define the style of simulation being performed via the
<A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style</A> command are sub-classes of the Simulator
class.  These include ODE solvers, a Gillespie solve, and a spatial
solver for spatial simulations.  See the simulator.h file for a list
of methods these classed define.
</P>
<P>Here is a brief description of the class methods required:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >init</TD><TD > setup a simulation</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >run</TD><TD > the timestepper 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<HR>

<A NAME = "command"></A><H4>New Top-level Commands 
</H4>
<P>It is possible to add a new command to a ChemCell input script as
opposed to adding a new style to an existing command (region, fix,
simulator).  For example the run and write_restart commands are
top-level ChemCell commands that are listed in the Command section of
style.h.  When such a command is encountered in the ChemCell input
script, the topmost level of ChemCell (ChemCell.cpp) simply creates a
class with the corresponding name, invokes the "command" method of the
class, and passes it the arguments from the input script.  The command
method can perform whatever operations it wishes on the ChemCell data
structures.
</P>
<P>Thus to add a new command, you simply need to add a *.cpp and *.h file
containing a single class:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >command</TD><TD > operations performed by the new command 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>Of course, the new class can define other methods and variables that
it uses internally.
