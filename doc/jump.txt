jump command :h3

[Syntax:]

jump file :pre

file = filename of new input script to switch to :ul

[Examples:]

jump newfile
jump in.run2 :pre

[Description:]

This command closes the current input script file, opens the file with
the specified name, and begins reading ChemCell commands from that
file.  The original file is not returned to.

It is possible to chain from file to file or back to the original file
using successive jump commands.  If the filename is a variable (see
the "variable"_variable.html command), different processor partitions
can run different input scripts.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"variable"_variable.html, "include"_include.html

[Default:] none
