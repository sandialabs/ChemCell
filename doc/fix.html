</P>
<P>Set a fix that will be applied during a simulation.  In ChemCell, a
"fix" is any operation that is applied to the system during
timestepping.  Examples include setting particle species types,
applying boundary conditions, or computing diagnostics.  There is
currently only a small number of fixes defined in ChemCell, but any
number can be added - see <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this section</A> of the
documentation for a discussion.
</P>
<P>Each fix style has its own documentation page which describes its
arguments and what it does.  For example, see the <A HREF = "fix_conc.html">fix
conc</A> page for information on style <I>conc</I>.
</P>
<P>Fixes perform their operations at different stages of the timestep.
If 2 or more fixes both operate at the same stage of the timestep,
they are invoked in the order they were specified in the input script.
</P>
<P>Specifying a new fix with the same ID as an existing fix effectively
replaces the old fix (and its parameters) with the new fix.  This can
only be done if the new fix has the same style as the existing fix.
</P>
<P>Fixes can be deleted with the <A HREF = "unfix.html">unfix</A> command.  Note that
this is the only way to turn off a fix; simply specifying a new fix
with a similar style will not turn off the first one.
</P>
<P>Here is an alphabetic list of fix styles currently defined in ChemCell:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "fix_conc_random.html">fix conc/random</A> - set the concentration of one or more species
<LI><A HREF = "fix_conc_set.html">fix conc/set</A> - set the concentration of one or more species
<LI><A HREF = "fix_dna_toggle.html">fix dna/toggle</A> - model DNA toggling on/off to modulate mRNA production
<LI><A HREF = "fix_rate_saturate.html">fix rate/saturate</A> - adjust the rate of one or more reactions
