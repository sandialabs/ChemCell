count command :h3

[Syntax:]

count species-ID N :pre

species-ID = particle species to populate
N = number of particles for stochastic models or \
    concentration (molarity) for ODE models :ul

[Examples:]

count Ca 1000
count receptor* 500 :pre

[Description:]

Set the initial particle count for a non-spatial models.  For
stochastic models (Gillespie), N is the particle count.  For
deterministic models (ODEs), N is the particle concentration in
molarity.

The species-ID can contain a single wildcard character * which will
match species and alias names in the usual way.  E.g. species-ID can
be *, ab*, *ab, ab*cd.

[Restrictions:] none

This command can only be used for non-spatial simulations.

[Default:]

Count = 0 for all species.
