<H3>probability command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>probability style value 
</PRE>
<LI>style = <I>max</I> or <I>diff</I> 

<PRE>  <I>max</I> value = Pmax = fraction between 0.0 and 1.0
  <I>diff</I> value = M = multiplier on sum of diffusive distances 
</PRE>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>probability max 0.5
probability diff 1.5 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set parameters that determine how binary reactions are computed for
spatial simulations.  A binary reaction occurs in a timestep with a
probability P when a pair of reactant particles are within a cutoff
distance R.
</P>
<P>The <I>max</I> style uses the specifed Pmax to set one distance R for all
reactions so that the fastest reaction (maximum rate constant) will
occur with probability Pmax and give the desired k for a well-mixed
system with diffusion-limited reactions.  Since other reactions happen
less frequently (smaller rate constants) their P values are set
smaller than the specified Pmax.
</P>
<P>The <I>diff</I> style sets a distance R for each reaction based on the
diffusion coefficients of its 2 reactants.  The sum of the root-mean
squared value for each reactant is multipled by the specified M factor
to compute R.  The P for each reaction is then set so that each
reaction happens at the desired frequency for a well-mixed system with
diffusion-limitd reactions.
</P>
<P>Note that values of P and R for individual reactions can be overridden
via the <A HREF = "react_modify.html">react_modify</A> command.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used for spatial simulations.
