<H3>probability command

<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>probability style value 
</PRE>
<P>style = <I>max</I> or <I>diff</I>
  <I>max</I> value = fraction between 0.0 and 1.0
  <I>diff</I> value = multiplier on sum of diffusive distances
</P>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>probability max 0.5
probability diff 1.5 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set parameters that determine how binary reactions are computed for
spatial simulations.  A binary reactions occurs in a timestep with a
probability P when a pair of reactant particles are within a cutoff
distance R.
</P>
<P>The <I>max</I> style sets one distance R for all reactions so that the
fastest reaction (max value of k) will occur with probability P and
give the desired k for a well-mixed system.  Since other reactions
should happen less frequently (smaller k values) their P values are
set smaller than the specified P.
</P>
<P>The <I>diff</I> style sets a distance R for each reaction based on the
diffusion coefficients of its 2 reactants.  The sum of the RMS value
for each reactant is multipled by the specified factor to compute R.
The P for each reaction is then chosen so that each reaction happens
at the desired frequency for a well-mixed system.
