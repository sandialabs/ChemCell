probability command :h3

[Syntax:]

probability style value :pre

style = {max} or {diff}
  {max} value = fraction between 0.0 and 1.0
  {diff} value = multiplier on sum of diffusive distances

[Examples:]

probability max 0.5
probability diff 1.5 :pre

[Description:]

Set parameters that determine how binary reactions are computed for
spatial simulations.  A binary reactions occurs in a timestep with a
probability P when a pair of reactant particles are within a cutoff
distance R.

The {max} style sets one distance R for all reactions so that the
fastest reaction (max value of k) will occur with probability P and
give the desired k for a well-mixed system.  Since other reactions
should happen less frequently (smaller k values) their P values are
set smaller than the specified P.

The {diff} style sets a distance R for each reaction based on the
diffusion coefficients of its 2 reactants.  The sum of the RMS value
for each reactant is multipled by the specified factor to compute R.
The P for each reaction is then chosen so that each reaction happens
at the desired frequency for a well-mixed system.
