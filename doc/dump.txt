dump command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID N filename species1-ID species2-ID ...
dump ID delta filename species1-ID species2-ID ... :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump
N = dump particles every N timesteps (integer value)
delta = dump particles every delta seconds (floating point value)
filename = file to dump to
speciesN-ID = optional list of species-IDs to dump to file :ul

[Examples:]

dump 1 100 tmp.dump
dump Ca-dump 0.1 tmp.dump.Ca Ca-cyto Ca-ER :pre

[Description:]

Dump a snapshot of particle coordinates and species types to a file
every so often as a simulation runs.  The species list is optional; if
not specified, all particles are dumped.

The ID of a dump can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.

The frequency of output can be specied in timesteps or elapsed
simulation time.  Using an integer versus a floating-point value (with
a decimal point) determines how the argument is interpreted.

Any species-ID can contain a single wildcard character * which will
match species and alias names in the usual way.  E.g. a species-ID can
be *, ab*, *ab, ab*cd.

Multiple dumps (with different IDs) can be defined.  See the
"undump"_undump.html command for turning off a dump.

The format of the dump file is self-explanatory.  For each particle,
an ID, its species type (an an integer), and its x,y,z coordinates are
printed.  Dump files can be visualized with the "Pizza.py
toolkit"_pizza or converted into other formats (via Pizza.py) suitable
for visualization with other tools, e.g. "VMD"_vmd.
