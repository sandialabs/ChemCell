dump command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID N filename species1-ID species2-ID ...
dump ID delta filename species1-ID species2-ID ...

ID = user-assigned name for the dump
N = dump particles every N timesteps (integer)
delta = dump particles every delta seconds (floating point)
filename = file to dump to
speciesN-ID = optional list of species-IDs to dump to file :ul

[Examples:]

dump 1 100 tmp.dump
dump Ca-dump 0.1 tmp.dump.Ca Ca-cyto Ca-ER :pre

[Description:]

Dump a snapshot of particle coordinates and species type to a file
every so often as a simulation runs.  The species list is optional; if
not specified, all particles are dumped.

Any species-ID can contain a single wildcard character * which will
match species and alias names in the usual way.  E.g. a species-ID can
be *, ab*, *ab, ab*cd.

Multiple dumps (with different IDs) can be defined.  See the
"undump"_undump.html command for turning off a dump.

[Restrictions:]

Dumps cannot be defined for non-spatial simulations (Gillespie) since
particle coordinates are not defined.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
