<H3>seed command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>seed N 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>N = integer random number seed (8 digits or less) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>seed 5982983
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the random # seed used for the simulation.  For non-spatial
simulations (Gillespie) random numbers are used to pick reactions and
variable timesteps.  For spatial simulations, random numbers are
assigned to particles when they are read in and used thereafter for
diffusive motion and reaction probabilities.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> none
</P>
<P>For spatial simulations, this command must be used before particles
are read in, else it will have no effect.
</P>
<P><B>Related commands:</B> none
</P>
<P><B>Default:</B>
</P>
<P>If not specified, the seed is set by the current system time when the
simulation is run.  This is a valid random seed, but means the seed
will be different the next time the input script is run.
