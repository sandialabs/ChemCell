<H3>seed command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>seed N 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>N = integer random number seed (positive integer) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>seed 5982983
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the random # seed used for the simulation.  For stochastic
non-spatial (Gillespie) simulatoins, random numbers are used to pick
reactions and timesteps.  For spatial simulations, random numbers are
assigned to particles when they are read in and used thereafter to
compute diffusive motion and reaction probabilities.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>For spatial simulations, this command must be used before particles
are read in, else it will have no effect.
</P>
<P><B>Related commands:</B> none
</P>
<P><B>Default:</B>
</P>
<P>If not specified, the seed is set by the current system time when the
simulation is run.  This is a valid random seed, but means the seed
will be different the next time the input script is run.
