:line

debug command :h3

[Syntax:]

debug proc-ID timestep index

proc-ID = processor (0 to P-1) to perform debug testing on
timestep = timestep to do testing on 
index = particle index (0 to N-1) to perform testing on :ul

[Examples:]

debug 0 145 7555 :pre

[Description:]

Track the diffusive motion of a single particle on a single processor
during a single timestep.  This enables tracking of its interactions
with regions, triangles, etc for debugging purposes.

To turn off debugging for a subsequent run, set proc-ID to -1.

[Restrictions:]

In order to use this command, ChemCell must be compiled with this line
at the top of move.cpp uncommented:

#define DEBUG_MOVE

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
