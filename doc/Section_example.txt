4. Example problems :h3

The ChemCell distribution includes an examples sub-directory with
several sample problems.  Each problem is in a sub-directory of its
own.  Each problem has an input script (in.*) and produces a log file
(log.*).  If may also produce a dump file (dump.*) when it runs.  Some
use one or more data files (data.*) of geometry or particle info as
additional input.  These were created via the "Pizza.py"_pizza
pre-processing tool using the *.py scripts in the same directory.

Plots can be made from the log files using the "olog" and plotting
tools in Pizza.py.  Images and movies can be made from the dump and
data files using the "cdata", "dump", and various visualization tools
in Pizza.py.  Examples are shown on the "ChemCell WWW Site"_cws.

These are the sample problems in the examples sub-directories:

abc: simple A + B -> C reaction
kinase: 3-stage kinase cascade
lotka: Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system
ecoli: E Coli chemotaxis signaling pathway model :tb(s=:)

Here is how you might run and visualize one of the sample problems:

cd kinase
cp ../../src/ccell_linux .         # copy ChemCell executable to this dir
ccell_linux < in.kinase            # run the problem :pre

Running the simulation produces the files {dump.kinase} and
{log.ccell}.  Assuming you have Pizza.py installed, you could
visualize the dump file as follows:

pizza -f dview.py dump.kinase :pre
