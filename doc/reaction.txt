reaction command :h3

[Syntax:]

reaction ID K product1 product2 ...
reaction ID reactant1 K product1 product2 ...
reaction ID reactant1 reactant2 K product1 product2 ... :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the reaction
reactant1,reactant2 = species-IDs of reactant(s)
K = reaction rate (see units below)
productN = species-IDs of zero or more products :ul

[Examples:]

reaction 1 Ca_cyto IP3R 1.0e7 IP3R Ca_er
reaction decay receptor-active 0.1 receptor-inactive
reaction influx 1.0e-8 Ca :pre

[Description:]

Define a reaction that turns reactants into products at a specified
reaction rate.  The reaction can have zero, one, or two reactants and
0 or more products.

The ID of a reaction can contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores and dashes.

The species-IDs of all reactants and products must have been
previously defined using the "species"_species.html command.

The units of the reaction rate K are molarity/sec for reactions with 0
reactants, 1/sec for unary reactions, and 1/molarity-sec for binary
reactions.

The "react_modify"_react_modify.html command can be used to specify
the spatial location of created products as well as other reaction
attributes.

[Restrictions:]

Reactions with 0 reactants can only be specified for non-spatial
simulations.

The maximum number of product species for any one reaction is
hard-wired in src/react.cpp via the MAX_PRODUCT setting.  Currently it
is set to 5.

[Default:] none
