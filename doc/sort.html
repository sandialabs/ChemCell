<H3>sort command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>sort flag 
</PRE>
<LI>flag = <I>no</I> or <I>yes</I> 

<P><B>Examples:</B>

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Turn sorting of particles on or off when performing a spatial
simulation.  Sorting of particles is done when particles are assigned
to reaction bins (see the <A HREF = "bin.html">bin</A>) command.  If sorting is
enabled, the selection and ordering of reactions performed during two
simulations should be the same, independent of how many processors
they are run on.  Thus the output of the two simulations should be
identical, which can be useful when debugging various problems.
</P>
<P>Note that sorting does not affect the accuracy of simulation output in
a statistical sense, but does slow down a simulation due to the extra
work involved.  Thus it should not normally be enabled, unless for
debugging purposes.
</P>
<P>Also note that getting the same answer for two simulations run on
different numbers of processors requires that the two simulations be
initiated with the same random number seed.  Thus the <A HREF = "seed.hmtl">seed</A>
command should be used, else a time-dependent random number seed will
be generated for each simulation.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used for spatial simulations.
