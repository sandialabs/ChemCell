stats command :h3

[Syntax:]

stats N species1-ID species2-ID ...
stats delta species1-ID species2-ID ... :pre

N = print stats every N timesteps (integer value)
delta = print stats every delta seconds (floating point value)
speciesN-ID = optional list of species IDs :ul

[Examples:]

stats 100
stats 0.01 Ca_cyto Ca_er :pre

[Description:]

Print particle statistics to the screen (and log file) every so often
as a simulation runs.  Setting N = 0 will only print statistics at the
beginning and end of the run.  The units for the particle stats are
specified by the "stats_modify"_stats_modify.html command.  The
default is particle count.

The frequency of output can be specied in timesteps or elapsed
simulation time.  Using an integer versus a floating-point value (with
a decimal point) determines how the argument is interpreted.

For stochastic non-spatial (Gillepsie) simulations, N refers to a
number of reactions, since there is one timestep/reaction.

The list of species is optional.  If not specified, counts for all
species will be printed.

Any species-ID can contain a single wildcard character * which will
match species and alias names in the usual way.  E.g. a species-ID can
be *, ab*, *ab, ab*cd.

[Restrictions:] none
