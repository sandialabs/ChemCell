ChemCell is a particle-based reaction/diffusion simulator designed for
modeling protein networks in biological cells with spatial
information.  Spatial simulations can be run efficiently on parallel
computers.  Non-spatial simulations can also be run using an ODE
solver or the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA).

ChemCell was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US
Department of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE.  It is an
open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the GNU Public
License (GPL).

The authors of the code are Steve Plimpton and Alex Slepoy, who can be
emailed at sjplimp@sandia.gov and alexander.slepoy@nnsa.doe.gov.  The
ChemCell WWW Site at www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/chemcell.html has more
information about the code and its uses.
