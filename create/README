This is quick start info for running chemcreate:

1. Change into the run directory

2. At command line, run the following command:

> cd ../src;make;cd ../run

This generates an executable in the run directory called "chemcreate".

3. Run chemcreate with a script using the following example syntax:

> ./chemcreate ../scripts/synecho_create/in.synecho_test

4. Now the run directory contains surface and particle output files
specified in the script. These can be used as input files to chemcell
and can be viewed in gui3d.
